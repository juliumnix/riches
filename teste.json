            "background_details": "\nPre-history\nBitcoin borrows from nearly three decades of research by academics, cypherpunk practitioners, and hobbyists who tried to create similar payment protocols. Some of the most prominent projects that preceded Bitcoin include: Digicash, b-money, Hashcash, e-gold, and Bit Gold. Bitcoin is often associated with Austrian economic theories, anarcho-capitalist principles, and general libertarian politicking by virtue of the exclusive developer community to whom Nakamoto first released their white paper, certain protocol design characteristics, and the political affiliations of early Bitcoin investors. \n\nConception to Launch\nOn October 31, 2008, at the peak of the Global Financial Crisis, just six weeks after the infamous investment bank, Lehman Brothers, declared bankruptcy, the pseudonymous \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/satoshi-nakamoto\"\u003eSatoshi Nakamoto\u003c/a\u003e released the Bitcoin whitepaper to the cryptography mailing list. Titled \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\", the whitepaper proposed a new electronic cash system that would allow fully peer-to-peer online payments without reliance on trusted third parties. Soon after the release of the whitepaper, Satoshi implemented the Bitcoin software as open-source code. On 3 January 2009, the Bitcoin network came into existence with Satoshi mining the genesis block of Bitcoin, which included a now-famous \"The Times\" headline in the \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/coinbase-transaction\"\u003ecoinbase\u003c/a\u003e both to prove the network’s fair launch and to make a political statement about the global financial system. The event marked the birth of the world's first non-sovereign, decentralized, digital money.\n\nPost Launch\n\u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/hal-finney\"\u003eHal Finney\u003c/a\u003e, who invented the first reusable proof-of-work system (RPoW) in 2004, received the first Bitcoin transaction (10 bitcoins) on January 12, 2009. In 2010, the first known commercial transaction using bitcoin occurred when programmer \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/laszlo-hanyecz\"\u003eLaszlo Hanyecz\u003c/a\u003e bought two Papa John's pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins. \n\nIn August 2010, a major vulnerability in the Bitcoin protocol was spotted and exploited in the Bitcoin network, allowing users to create an infinite amount of bitcoins. The transactions exploiting the vulnerability were quickly spotted and erased for the Bitcoin blockchain, with the vulnerability being patched in a network upgrade of the Bitcoin protocol. This was the only major security flaw found and exploited in Bitcoin's history.\n\nIn December 2010, amidst rising publicity from Bitcoin's use in financing Wikileaks, Satoshi Nakamoto, disappeared from involvement with Bitcoin. It is unknown why Satoshi disappeared from the project, although some believe Satoshi, cognizant of past struggles to launch a digital currency, recognized that a leader of the Bitcoin project could be a central point of failure. It is estimated that Nakamoto had mined about one million bitcoins before disappearing in 2010 when he handed the network alert key and control of the code repository over to \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/gavin-andresen\"\u003eGavin Andresen\u003c/a\u003e.\n\nSilk Road \u0026 Mt. Gox\nOne of the most iconic early use cases for Bitcoin was the Silk Road. Launched in early 2011, the Silk Road was a darknet marketplace that allowed users to buy and sell a wide variety of goods including, most notably, illegal drugs. Underpinning the Silk Road was the Tor network, which allowed users to browse the Silk Road anonymously and securely without potential traffic monitoring, and Bitcoin which provided a censorship-resistant payment rail for pseudonymous transactions. Over the course of its life, it is estimated that the Silk Road facilitated more than $1.2 billion in transactions, collecting over $80 million in sales commissions, leveraging the Bitcoin network as its payment rail. The site was shut down in 2013 when the FBI took advantage of the Silk Road’s centralized infrastructure, arresting founder \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/ross-ulbricht\"\u003eRoss Ulbricht\u003c/a\u003e, and shuttering the site.\n\nFounded by \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/jed-mccaleb\"\u003eJed McCaleb\u003c/a\u003e in July 2010, and led by \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/mark-karpeles\"\u003eMark Karpeles\u003c/a\u003e until it collapsed, \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/organization/mtgox\"\u003eMt. Gox\u003c/a\u003e was one of the earliest Bitcoin exchanges in the world. Based in Tokyo, Japan, the exchange would go on to handle over 70% of all bitcoin (BTC) transactions worldwide at its peak. Known for its chronic security issues, Mt. Gox was infamously hacked in 2014, losing 850,000 bitcoins worth about $450 million at the time. The hack sent the price of Bitcoin, which was in the midst of one of its first major price bubbles, plummeting. Bitcoin would sink into a bear market with prices not recovering until the 2017 bull run.\n\n2017 Bubble \u0026 Bitcoin Cash Hard Fork\nThe 2017 price bubble was a watershed moment for Bitcoin. The price of Bitcoin rose more than 1900% from just under $1,000 at the beginning of the year to near $20,000 at its peak in December. At its peak, Bitcoin's market capitalization eclipsed $325 billion. Along with the proliferation of Initial Coin Offerings, powered by Ethereum, Bitcoin's incredible 2017 run propelled cryptocurrency into mainstream consciousness, among the most discussed phenomena of 2017.\n\nAlso notable in 2017, Bitcoin experienced its \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/bitcoin-cash-hard-fork\"\u003emost contentious fork to date\u003c/a\u003e. Amidst rising transaction fees on Bitcoin and increasingly divergent views on scaling Bitcoin, an agreement was reached amongst prominent Bitcoin stakeholders in what is now known as the \"New York Agreement\". The agreement was to support a set of network upgrades called SegWit2x. The proposal was backed by over 80% of Bitcoin's hash rate. However, despite the desires of miners, users wanted to activate \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/segregated-witness\"\u003eSegWit\u003c/a\u003e without the 2MB block size increase, the philosophy underpinning this decision being that the users controlled the network, not miners and Bitcoin businesses. Subsequently, they set a date (August 1, 2017) where Bitcoin would soft fork to support SegWit and keep the 1MB block size. Enough nodes signaled support for it that they forced miners to accept or have their blocks rejected by the network. A faction of the bigger blocks camp, rejected SegWit altogether, citing frustrations with the prioritization of SegWit over bigger blocks, and on August 1, 2017, they launched a hard fork of Bitcoin called Bitcoin Cash, with 8MB block limits. These events marked, one end, a landmark demonstration of power by the users of the Bitcoin network, and on the other end, the first great schism within the Bitcoin community.\n\n2018 - 2019\nAfter peaking in December 2017, Bitcoin, along with the rest of the cryptocurrency market in January 2018, crashed, sending the cryptocurrency market into its latest bear market. Since then Bitcoin has dropped as low as $3,200, more than 80% below its ATH. However, while prices have yet to recover to 2017 highs, the institutionalization of Bitcoin has picked up significantly. Traditional Wall Street institutions including Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Intercontinental Exchange, and Fidelity have all launched cryptocurrency offerings, opening up the market to institutional investors. There are now several regulated exchanges and custodians. Furthermore, regulatory clarity around Bitcoin has improved dramatically with SEC Chairman, Jay Clayton, revealing at a Congressional hearing in February 2018, that the SEC does not consider Bitcoin to be a security.\n\nSince it reached its cycle low in February 2019, Bitcoin's price has recovered considerably, rising as high as $13,000 in June. With the recent announcements of Facebook's Libra project and China's Central Bank digital currency, governments and multinational corporations around the world have begun to look at cryptocurrencies more seriously. American officials are debating a digital dollar and lawmakers around the world are considering the central bank digital currency (CBDC) options. Furthermore, there have been numerous cryptocurrency-related hearings since Libra was announced. China has recently \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/china-blockchain-madness\"\u003eannounced\u003c/a\u003e blockchain was a revolutionary technology and that it would make blockchain technology a strategic imperative for the country. Bitcoin's price rose more than 40% after the announcement, its highest intraday movement since 2011.\n\n2020 - 2021\nBitcoin traded sideways into 2020, but the onset of the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic saw world markets take the biggest dips since at least the 2007-08 Mortgage Crisis. Bitcoin did not escape the dip – in less than 48 hours it lost half of its value, going below $4,000 for the first time since March of 2019. Luckily for bitcoiners, bitcoin rebounded, returning to its pre-pandemic price in less than a month.\n\nBitcoin’s ascent recovery out of the March turmoil drew wider media and institutional attention and lent credibility to its store of value narrative. Although it remained around $10,000 throughout Ethereum’s firey \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/a-data-driven-look-at-the-end-of-defi-s-summer\"\u003eDeFi summer\u003c/a\u003e, bitcoin would start to trend upwards into the fall and by early November bitcoin hit $14,000. Whether it was unprecedented levels of money printing by the Federal Reserve, its V-shaped recovery in April, or direct stimulus payments to millions of Americans, it was clear bitcoin wasn’t done at $14,000 as it crossed $20,000 for the first time ever on December 16, 2020. Two weeks later it hit $28,000. Then, on January 8, 2021, bitcoin set a new all-time high of $41,429.38. Since hitting $41,000 bitcoin has mostly drifted in the $30,000.\n\nBitcoin’s price wasn’t the only thing rapidly accelerating in 2020. Institutional adoption skyrocketed. Led by Paul Tudor Jones of Microstrategy (  $1 billion), institutions joined the bitcoin world en masse. From insurance companies like MassMutual ($100 million) to investment firms like Ruffer ($744 million) new groups \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/the-potential-impact-of-increased-capital-allocation-to-bitcoin\"\u003econtinue\u003c/a\u003e to adopt bitcoin. And institutions aren’t alone – entrepreneurs like Elon Musk and politicians like Miami Mayor Francis Suarez have increasingly promoted bitcoin. Even athletes have joined the space, as NFL player Russell Okung partnered with Bitcoin Lightning Company \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/organization/zap\"\u003eZap\u003c/a\u003e to become the first professional sports player ever to be paid in bitcoin\n\n",

Economic nodes (aka \"full nodes\") receive transactions from other network participants, validate them against network consensus rules and double-spend vectors, and propagate the transactions to other full nodes that also validate and propagate. Valid transactions are sent to the network's mempool waiting for mining nodes to confirm them via inclusion in the next block.\n\nMining nodes work to empty the mempool usually in a highest-to-lowest fee order by picking transactions to include in the next block and racing against each other to generate a hash less than the target number set by Bitcoin's difficulty adjustment algorithm. Bitcoin uses a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to establish the chain of blocks with the most accumulated “work” (a.k.a., energy spent on solved hashes) as the valid chain. Other network peers can cheaply verify the chain’s work.\n\nMining difficulty regularly adjusts to maintain Bitcoin's average ten-minute block schedule. Mining nodes add new blocks to whatever chain has the largest accumulated proof of work maintained by a network of economic nodes with downloaded copies of the same chain.\n\nLearn More:\nBitcoin Developer's Guide\nMastering Bitcoin",

        "governance": {
          "governance_details": "Model Overview\nBitcoin governance is the process by which protocol rules are decided upon, implemented, and enforced. Users (full nodes) adopt new rules according to their subjective views on what Bitcoin is and should be. If two or more individuals adopt the same set of rules, they form an inter-subjective social consensus of what “Bitcoin” is. It is in this respect that many conceptualize Bitcoin as being set by a social contract. Every time rule changes are contemplated, the rules of the contract are decided and renegotiated continuously between stakeholders. Protocol changes are legitimized when users agree to adopt the new changes. Once adopted, the Bitcoin protocol automates the enforcement of the social contract.\n\nProcess Overview\nProtocol development is governed by a proposal process whereby anyone in the open-source Bitcoin community can submit \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/bitcoin-improvement-proposal-bip\"\u003eBitcoin Improvement Proposals\u003c/a\u003e (\"BIPs\"). After debate by the community, when consensus has emerged, the Bitcoin Core maintainers merge code changes into Bitcoin Core's GitHub Repository. Once new code has been implemented into the Bitcoin Core client, users of the network (full nodes) must be persuaded to adopt the new changes. Protocol changes are “ratified” on-chain when the majority of the network adopts the upgrade and doesn’t break consensus.\n\nOnce rules are adopted on-chain, all new transactions and block proposals are subject to the agreed-upon rules. Full nodes only accept new transactions and block proposals that are valid according to the rules of the Bitcoin protocol. Anything that is not valid will be rejected. Thus, miners must implement the prevailing rules of the network in order to participate in the block creation process. \n\nUser Activated Hard Fork\n2017's \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/bitcoin-cash-hard-fork\"\u003eUser Activated Soft Fork Event\u003c/a\u003e provided an illustrative case study on Bitcoin governance in practice. \n\nAs early as 2010, shortly after Satoshi implemented a block limit into Bitcoin, discussions around block size began. These discussions largely stayed in the background until 2017 when tensions within the Bitcoin community rose over rising transaction fees and increasingly divergent opinions on scaling Bitcoin. In May 2017, a meeting between miners, businesses, investors, and core developers took place at the Consensus conference in New York, in what is now referred to as the \"New York Agreement\". The product of this meeting was an agreement to support \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/segregated-witness\"\u003eSegWit\u003c/a\u003e (a soft fork) and a 2MB block size (hard fork). \n\nKnown as SegWit2x, this proposal was backed by over 80% of the network’s hash rate. However, despite the desires of miners, users wanted to activate SegWit without the block size increase. This plan was proposed as BIP 148, a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal, from a pseudonymous developer named \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/shaolin-fry\"\u003eShaolinfry\u003c/a\u003e. Soon after, users set a date (August 1, 2017) where Bitcoin would soft fork to support SegWit and keep the 1MB block size. Eventually, enough nodes signaled support for it, forcing miners to accept or have their blocks rejected by the network. \n\nMany see this user-activated soft fork (UASF) as a pivotal moment in Bitcoin’s history. The philosophy underpinning the event was that users controlled the network, not miners. The event not only illustrated the balance of power within Bitcoin's network, but also calmed suspicions that parties such as miners, businesses, or Bitcoin Core developers, controlled Bitcoin. \n\nLearn More: \nBitcoin Governance\nUnpacking Bitcoin's Social Contract\nWho Controls Bitcoin Core?\nBitcoin Miners Beware: Invalid Blocks Need Not Apply",

            "background_details": "Conception to token sale\n\u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/vitalik-buterin\"\u003eVitalik Buterin\u003c/a\u003e conceived Ethereum in 2013, after what he perceived as limitations in the functionality of Bitcoin’s scripting language, namely the lack of Turing completeness. Buterin published the first Ethereum white paper later that year, describing a distributed computing platform for executing smart contracts and building \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/decentralized-applications-dapps\"\u003edecentralized applications (dApps)\u003c/a\u003e. In 2014, Buterin and some other early contributors founded the \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/organization/ethereum-foundation\"\u003eEthereum Foundation\u003c/a\u003e, a non-profit organization dedicated to Ethereum’s research, core protocol development, and ecosystem growth. The foundation's first task was to host the Ethereum crowdsale, which raised 31,529 \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/bitcoin\"\u003eBTC\u003c/a\u003e (~$18 million at the time) in exchange for about 60 million ether, and use the proceeds to fund the network's initial development. The Ethereum Foundation continues to be the primary funding organization, issuing grants to research teams and projects focused on Ethereum.\n\nThe rise of initial coin offerings (ICOs)\nEthereum's mainnet launched in July 2015, with the first live release known as Frontier. Shortly thereafter, Augur (\u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/augur\"\u003eREP\u003c/a\u003e) conducted the first \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/initial-coin-offering-ico\"\u003eInitial Coin Offering (ICO)\u003c/a\u003e, in which the startup sold its Ethereum-based REP tokens (created via the \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/erc-20\"\u003eERC-20\u003c/a\u003e standard) to help fund the project. The ability to develop and sell a newly generated token to help raise capital became an attractive method of fundraising because projects could circumvent the legal policies and costs required from traditional companies (until more recently). Ethereum-focused startups created thousands of new tokens since Augur's ICO, raising billions of dollars in the process.\n\nThe DAO hack\nIn April 2016, a decentralized venture fund known as \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/the-dao\"\u003eThe DAO\u003c/a\u003e hosted an ICO, raising ~$150 million in ETH in the process. A few months later (July 2016), an attacker exploited a bug in one of The DAO's smart contracts, enabling the guilty party to siphon 3.6 million ETH. A significant portion of the Ethereum community opted to revert the chain to remove The DAO and its subsequent hack from the network's history. The remaining stakeholders held the preservation of immutability in higher regard and refused to accept a ledger rewrite. The divide in the community led to a contentious hard fork a few weeks post-hack, causing a permanent split in the network. The legacy chain that did not reverse its transaction history is now known as Ethereum Classic (\u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/ethereum-classic\"\u003e$ETC\u003c/a\u003e).\n\nThe path to scalability: Ethereum 2.0\nScalability is a known limitation for the current state of Ethereum. Periods of high user activity, as seen during the CryptoKitties launch in Nov. 2017 and the DeFi bonanza during the Summer of 2020, can cause transaction times and fees to skyrocket, which often prices out retail users and newcomers.\n\nThe potential shortcomings of Ethereum's current design are nothing new to Ethereum developers. Various teams have been working since the launch of Ethereum to upgrade the network to account for better scalability and security measures without compromising the community's values of decentralization. The current plan is to swap Ethereum's consensus layer from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and implement a scaling technique known as sharding in a massive upgrade called Serenity (also referred to as Ethereum 2.0).\n\nEthereum developers have broken down this upgrade into three or more phases to minimize complexity as they add more features. The first phase Phase 0 has a minimum launch date of Dec. 1, 2020. It will bring the Beacon Chain (the backbone of Ethereum 2.0) to life and enable the network to bootstrap a stable of validators to ensure network security. The following phases are being developed in parallel but might take several years before they reach completion.",

Version 1.0 also featured a hardcoded gas limit of 5000 gas per block to prevent any issues with node installation. The gas limit lasted only a few days post-launch before being automatically removed. To avoid unwanted chain forks, Frontier contained Canary contracts as well. Canary contracts gave Ethereum core developers the ability to stop specific operations or transactions before a miner wandered off to an orphaned chain.

              "details": "The launch of Berlin, the second step of the Istanbul upgrade, should occur at some point in 2020. Ethereum core developers split Istanbul into two phases because two of the EIPs up for discussion require extensive testing and development before launch. At the moment, core devs have approved and raised two EIPs to accepted status. There are two other proposed EIPs that may be ready in time for Berlin.\n\nAccepted\nEIP-2315 implements simple subroutines for the EVM which could lower gas costs and make states analysis easier\nEIP 2537 (which superseded EIP-1962) implements a single BLS curve to make it easier to deploy and manage rollup contracts and zk-SNARKs/STARKs\n\nProposed\nEIP-2046 reduces the gas cost for static calls made to precompiled contracts\nEIP-2565 will re-price the ModExp precompile (EIP-198) to enable more cost-efficient verification of RSA signatures, verifiable delay functions (VDFs), and primality checks, among other functions\n\nIstanbul Phase II notably excludes any EIPs related to the difficulty bomb (i.e., the Ethereum \"ice age\"). The core developers concluded, \"there's no major reason do it now\" because the difficulty bomb is only necessary once Ethereum 2.0 and its Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism are activated. Overlooking an Ice Age EIP for now also prevents any further delays in Berlin's development phase.\n\nCore devs and the greater Ethereum community also excludes the EIP-1057, the proposal for the now-infamous ProgPoW (short for Progressive Proof-of-Work). It aimed to alter Ethereum's hashing algorithm to close the performance efficiency gap between generalized and specialized mining hardware (otherwise known as ASICs). While GPU miners and some core devs favored the proposal, many in the community were vehemently against it. Therefore, all sides agree to a href=\"https://messari.io/article/progpow-wars-ethereum-dev-call-places-a-spotlight-on-the-progpow-debate\"not include ProgPoW/a in any upcoming forks as no protocol changes are worth triggering a network split\n\nLearn more:\nBerlin EIPs spreadsheet"

This initial phase will introduce the Beacon Chain, which will serve as the backbone for Ethereum 2.0's sharded network architecture. As opposed to Ethereum's current Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchain, the Beacon Chain will use Casper FFG, a specific variation of Proof-of-Stake (PoS), and a system of validators to confirm transactions and inhibit Sybil attacks.\n\nEthereum core developers split the Serenity upgrade into three phases to optimize the development process and limit deployment risks. The specifications for this first phase include:\nBeacon Chain is the core of the Ethereum 2.0 system; it manages the PoS protocol for itself and all of the individual shard chains. The Beacon chain will use Casper the Friendly Finality Gadget (Casper FFG) to ensure transaction finality.\nFork Choice enables validators' clients to automatically select the right chain when the Phase 0 Serenity fork is initiated\nDeposit Contract allows Ethereum stakeholders to transfer funds from ETH 1.0 to ETH 2.0 and claim rights to a validator role on the new PoS chain\nHonest Validator dictates the expected behavior of an \"honest validator and slashing specifications with respect to Phase 0 of ETH 2.0\n\nIt is essential to note the launch of Phase 0 will not immediately replace Ethereum 1.0 (also known as Ethereum 1.x). The two chains will coexist for at least until Serenity Phase 1.5 arrives, which marks when the current Ethereum chain will merge into the Ethereum 2.0 system a shard within the network. Running the legacy and future chains in parallel may cause ETH inflation to increase as both chains will simultaneously mint new tokens."

Clayton carried on to say that the Howey test framework, the test used by the SEC to determine if certain transactions qualify as \"investment contracts,\" is not static. Therefore, digital tokens first defined as securities can shift to non-securities over time, depending on how they are managed and exchanged.\n\nU.S. Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) chairman Heath Tarbert echoed the SEC's findings in Oct. 2019, adding that he views ether as a commodity.\n  “We've been very clear on bitcoin: bitcoin is a commodity. We haven't said anything about ether—until now. It is my view as chairman of the CFTC that ether is a commodity.”\n\nWhile ether in its current state is not a security, U.S. regulators have not commented on the legality of Ethereum's crowdsale. But Chairman Clayton did mention that most initial coin offerings (ICOs) look like unregistered securities sales.",

Those block rewards incentivize miners to secure the network. Miners that find an uncle block also receive 87.5% of the base block reward. Uncle blocks occur when several distinct miners simultaneously mine a block. In this case, the block that has the most accumulated PoW is conserved, and others are rejected. Unlike the Bitcoin chain that does not reward miners for orphan blocks, the Ethereum chain does reward uncle block miners. Transaction fees, however, are not awarded to uncle block miners. As \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/vitalik-buterin\"\u003eVitalik Buterin\u003c/a\u003e notes, the initial intent behind rewarding uncle block miners was to avoid mining centralization caused by the network lag that smaller miners could endure:\n  \"This mechanic was originally introduced to reduce centralization pressures, by reducing the advantage that well-connected miners have over poorly connected miners.\"\n\nIn 2017, the difficulty bomb increased block times drastically, thus reducing the issuance rate. Indeed, the difficulty bomb, also known as \"ice age\" was initially designed as a mechanism to disincentivize miners to continue mining the Ethereum chain by making it exponentially harder to create a new block. This was meant to accelerate the transition from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake.\n\nThe Casper development and transition to Proof-of-Stake being delayed, \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/vitalik-buterin\"\u003eVitalik Buterin\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/afri-schoedon\"\u003eAfri Schoeden\u003c/a\u003e proposed to delay the difficulty bomb and reduce the block rewards from 5 Ether to 3 Ether, thus leaving the system in the same general state as before. This proposal, EIP 649, was included in the Byzantium hard fork which was implemented on October 16, 2017, at block 4,370,000, thus effectively reducing block rewards from 5 Ether to 3 Ether and delaying the difficulty bomb for approximately 1.4 years.\n\nOn February 28, 2019, at block 7,280,000, the Constantinople hard fork further reduced block rewards from 3 Ether to 2 Ether, and once again delayed the difficulty bomb for approximately 12 months with EIP 1234.\n\nThe Ethereum's Parity multi-sig wallet bug\n\nOn November 06, 2017, a vulnerability in the \"library\" smart contract code was exploited by an anonymous user. Subsequently, the user destroyed the library contract. This destruction locked forever a total amount of 513,774.16 Ether located in 587 multi-signatures parity wallets. \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/messari-proprietary-methods\"\u003eMessari Proprietary Methodology\u003c/a\u003e to calculate liquid supply excludes any non-transferable coins. Thus, these locked Ether are considered illiquid and are not included in our liquid supply calculation.\n\nETH 2.0 and the transition to Casper Proof-of-Stake\n\nIn ETH 2.0, the Ethereum chain will be maintained via a new proof-of-stake system, where rewards will be distributed on a sliding scale based on the total amount staked on the network. The more total supply that’s staked, the higher the system-wide issuance rate (to incentivize high cumulative participation). Although individual yields will decline as the staking participation increases. A table posted by \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/vitalik-buterin\"\u003eVitalik Buterin\u003c/a\u003e on Github lays out the sliding scale issuance rate. \n\n\u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/justin-drake\"\u003eJustin Drake\u003c/a\u003e, a researcher at the \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/organization/ethereum-foundation\"\u003eEthereum Foundation\u003c/a\u003e, argued that targeting 30,000,000 ETH at stake, long-term, “seems about right for strong security.” It would represent about 30% of the network and result in an approximate 3% annual inflation. Nevertheless, the penalties applied to validators going offline as well as the slashing penalties and the transaction fees burnt due to EIP 1559 will lead to the destruction of Ether, thus reducing the total net issuance amount.\n\nThe transition to Proof-of-Stake will occur in three or four stages, according to the latest specifications shared by the core developers:\nPhase 0, expected for Dec. 1, 2020, will initially increase issuance compared to the current level. This is due to the fact that both the Proof-of-Work and Beacon Chain will run simultaneously and rewards will be distributed on both chains, although the staking participation, and thus annual issuance on the Beacon Chain, will most likely be very low during this Phase.\nPhase 1, expected for Q4 2021, will allow finalizing the Proof-of-Work chain with Proof-of-Stake. The Proof-of-Work rewards will most likely be reduced to match an issuance rate between 0.5% and 1% (versus 4.5% before Phase 1). Both Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake rewards will co-exist and the global issuance rate should be around 1% at that stage.\nPhase 1.5, estimated for 2022, will mark when Ethereum 2.0 transfers will likely unlock, giving stakers access to their previously inaccessible staked ETH and accumulated rewards. These rewards and staking amounts will date back to the launch of the Beacon Chain.\nPhase 2, estimated for 2023, will progressively lead to an increase of staking participation, thus increasing the annual issuance rate, while Proof-of-Work will simultaneously progressively disappear.\n\n",

              "consensus_details": "Modified GHOST protocol\nThe Ethereum White Paper states Ethereum uses a modified version of the \"Greedy Heaviest Observed Subtree\" (GHOST) protocol to distinguish the \"longest\" base chain (the chain with the most accumulated Proof-of-Work backing it) from forks. \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/nakamoto-consensus\"\u003eNakamoto Consensus\u003c/a\u003e, the implementation used by Bitcoin (\u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/bitcoin\"\u003e$BTC\u003c/a\u003e) and its forks, is problematic in networks with fast confirmation times (i.e., block times) like Ethereum. Quick block times lead to a higher stale or orphan rate, which can split mining resources among competing forks and reduce overall network security. Accelerated confirmation times also increases the likelihood a single mining pool could obtain a majority of the hashpower on a given chain.\n\nThe GHOST protocol attempts to solve this issue of network security by including orphan blocks in the calculation of the longest chain. Therefore, the GHOST model determines the valid chain by weighing the parent and further ancestors as well as the number of stale descendants. The protocol also rewards the mining of orphan blocks directly connected to the longest chain to combat potential centralization concerns. Orphan block miners do not receive any transaction fees, only a portion of the block subsidy, as stale transactions are not considered valid.\n\nSome say GHOST works better in theory than in practice, claiming Ethereum further modified its consensus implementation before (or soon after) launch to avoid security complications. Others suggest the Ethereum consensus model better resembles Nakamoto consensus or a modified version of the Inclusive protocol. But the inclusion of EIP-100 in the Byzantium fork changed Ethereum's difficulty calculation algorithm to include orphan blocks, which indicates the proposed modified GHOST implementation is intact. Regardless of the security model classification, Ethereum continues to reward orphan block miners with 87.5% of the base block reward.\n\nMining\nEthereum miners solve computational puzzles to generate new blocks by running the Ethash \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-work\"\u003eProof-of-Work (PoW)\u003c/a\u003e algorithm. In this process, miners compete to discover a valid hash, using the Keccak-256 and Keccak-512 hash functions, as defined by Ethereum's difficulty adjustment algorithm. Unlike Bitcoin's biweekly adjustments, Ethereum recalculates its difficulty level every block based on the time between the two previous blocks.\n\nCryptographers designed Ethash to be \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/blog/application-specific-integrated-circuits-asics\"\u003eASIC\u003c/a\u003e-resistant by making it memory intensive for specialized mining chips. But the popularity of Ethereum led mining chip manufacturer Bitmain to release the first ASICs miners for Ethash in April 2018. The majority of the Ethereum remains opposed to ASIC miners, as evidenced by its support for the ProgPoW EIP (a likely inclusion in the second Istanbul hard fork). Ethereum also plans to transition to a \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/proof-of-stake\"\u003eProof-of-Stake (PoS)\u003c/a\u003e consensus model, which would render any mining equipment obsolete.",

External contracts can create and sign messages to send to both types of accounts, while contract accounts can only execute transactions automatically in response to a message they have received. The latter are what are known as \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/smart-contracts\"\u003esmart contracts\u003c/a\u003e and enable the programmability of \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/decentralized-applications-dapps\"\u003edecentralized applications (dApps)\u003c/a\u003e.\n\nEthereum Virtual Machine\nThe heart of the Ethereum blockchain is known as the \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/ethereum-virtual-machine\"\u003eEthereum Virtual Machine (EVM)\u003c/a\u003e, which is the part of the protocol that executes transactions. It is a Turing complete virtual machine featuring a specific language “EVM bytecode,” typically written in a higher-level language called Solidity. Every operation on the EVM requires computational effort and memory. Ethereum node operators and miners provide these scarce resources to application developers and network users in exchange for gas. Different operations require different amounts of gas, and the user can specify how much they are willing to pay in ETH for each unit of gas. The amount of gas required for the transaction, along with the price paid, becomes the transaction cost. Every transaction also had a gas limit to prevent attacks from overloading blocks, which could slow down block production.\n\nDeveloper tools and token standards\nEthereum adopted \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/erc-20\"\u003eEthereum Request for Comment (ERC) 20\u003c/a\u003e in late 2015 as a standard for Ethereum smart contracts to issue tokens on the platform. The majority of tokens built on Ethereum are ERC-20 compliant, meaning they follow a standard set of rules defining how they are created and used. Another more popular token rule set is ERC-721 with standardizes the issuance of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) where any given token is distinguishable from another making them popular for gaming.\n\nEthereum 2.0\nAs Ethereum transitions to Eth 2.0, it will undergo significant changes to its design. It will transition from \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-work\"\u003eProof-of-Work\u003c/a\u003e to \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/proof-of-stake\"\u003eProof-of-Stake\u003c/a\u003e and feature a sharding architecture. Currently, nodes must validate every transaction to maintain an updated global state. The new sharding model segments the network into various groups (called shards) and randomly assigns nodes to each shard. Rather than having to monitor the entire chain, nodes only have to validate their respective shard(s). Individual shards shared their transaction details with the Beacon Chain, which acts as the backbone of Ethereum 2.0. The Beacon Chain serves to validate the transactions on each shard, helping the entire network reach consensus. It also identifies dishonest validators and initiates penalties in the form of slashing, in which a portion of a validator's stake is removed from circulation. Eth 2.0 will also replace the EVM with Ethereum WebAssembly (eWASM), which intends to translate coding logic more efficiently and help improve Ethereum’s scalability.",

Binance Coin is an ERC-20 token that was issued as part of an initial coin offering (ICO) to be used for discounted trading costs, with a percentage of the tokens burned every quarter.\n\nERC-20 tokens were replaced by native tokens when Binance launched Binance Chain, its own public blockchain, in April 2019. The team constructed Binance DEX, a decentralized exchange that allows traders to keep custody of their cash, on top of Binance Chain. Over time, the token has gained additional functionality, such as use in the Binance Launchpad lottery system and different payments in the Binance ecosystem.\n\nCEO Changpeng Zhao (\"CZ\") has also stated that 90% of Binance employees opt to earn a portion of their income in BNB.",

Initially, the sales were done on a first come first serve basis. They since pivoted to a lottery system where users can claim tickets based on the number of BNB tokens held over the prior 20 days. The tickets represent a certain allocation of tokens and are drawn randomly. If selected, the user is committed to purchasing that number of tokens at the listed price. \n\nBinance Chain\nBNB acts as the native token used as gas to pay for network transactions on Binance Chain, a high-performance blockchain network.

Half of the founders’ allocation was vested immediately. The other half is vested annually through 2021. From Q2 2019, these tokens will be burnt through quarterly burns and will thus remain illiquid until they are burnt.  Binance plans to burn 100 million BNB (50% of supply) over time and has successfully executed nine coin burns to date.\nInvestors receive 20 million BNB (10% of supply) with no vesting or lock-up restrictions. \nThe public sale distributed 100 million BNB (50% of supply). Binance launched the ERC-20 Binance Coin in a public sale on July 14, 2017. Half of the funds raised through Binance’s coin offering were intended for Binance branding and marketing, and roughly one-third of the funds were for platform upgrades and development.\n\nBinance executed the token swap from ERC-20 BNB tokens to Binance chain mainnet BNB coins on April 23, 2019. Binance Coins native to the Binance chain are called BEP2 BNB. Pre-selected validators produced blocks after the genesis block on April 18, 2019, and the first ERC-20 to BEP2 BNB swap of 5 million BNB was executed to a wallet belonging to Binance."

Nevertheless, in April 2019, Binance edited the white paper’s section devoted to quarterly repurchasing plans to replace it with a section on quarterly burn plans. In July 2019, Binance announced that it will burn the BNB tokens allocated to the Binance team going forward. As a result, the team allocation, that was initially supposed to be vesting for 4 years, will remain illiquid until all 80,000,000 BNB have been burnt. This reduces BNB's liquid supply, as these tokens are no longer liquid, but it also reduces the potential liquid supply inflation rate that would have occurred through the vesting of those tokens. \n\nAs of today, Binance has realized 15 quarterly token burns, leading to the destruction of 30,567,063 BNB:\n\nOctober 2017 - 986,000 BNB\nJanuary 2018 -  1,821,586 BNB\nApril 2018 -  2,220,314 BNB\nJuly 2018 -  2,528,767 BNB\nOctober 2018 - 1,643,986 BNB\nJanuary 2019 - 1,623,818 BNB.\nApril 2019 - 829,888 BNB\nJuly 2019 - 808,888 BNB\nOctober 2019 - 2,061,888 BNB\n10.

March 2021 - 1,099,888 BNB\n\nBinance will continue burning an amount of BNB equivalent to 20% of its quarterly profit until the outstanding supply (supply that exists on-chain) reaches 100,000,000 BNB.

Two months earlier, Binance chain’s testnet launched and was used by the internal Binance team and some high-volume traders for testing. \n\nBinance’s decentralized exchange (DEX) is built on the Binance blockchain using Tendermint and the Cosmos Software Developer Kit (SDK). Binance forked Cosmos to create the Binance blockchain, which currently does not support smart contract features. Binance aims to use the Tendermint consensus framework to solve some interoperability problems with inter-blockchain communication (IBC). \n\nBinance chain source code is currently not open source for competitiveness reasons, according to Binance. But the exchange plans to open source the DEX and blockchain codebases when both products gain more adoption. \n",

            "background_details": "Founded in July 2014 by \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/brock-pierce\"\u003eBrock Pierce\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/craig-sellars\"\u003eCraig Sellars\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/reeve-collins\"\u003eReeve Collins\u003c/a\u003e, Tether (USDT), originally known as \"Realcoin\", is a cryptocurrency commonly known as a “\u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/stablecoins\"\u003establecoin\u003c/a\u003e” that aims to keep a fixed 1:1 exchange ratio with the U.S. dollar. Tether was one of the earliest stablecoins created, built upon Mastercoin (Omni), which was a protocol layer for Bitcoin that introduced the stablecoin concept to the world in 2012. Tether pioneered what is now known as a fiat-collateralized stablecoin model, and is now the most widely used stablecoin today.\n\nTether was created as an attempt to solve two major issues with existing cryptocurrencies: high volatility and convertibility between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies. To address these perceived issues Tether created a cryptocurrency that is fully backed 1:1 by deposits of U.S. dollars held at banks. On Ethereum, USDT tokens are represented as ERC-20 tokens, while on Bitcoin, Tether utilizes the Omni layer, to represent USDT tokens. While the tokens themselves operate in a decentralized network, Hong Kong based \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/organization/tether-limited\"\u003eTether Ltd\u003c/a\u003e is solely responsible for creating and redeeming tokens as well as maintaining the 1:1 deposit backing. \n\nExchanges have been the primary users of USDT as an alternative to fiat currencies, reducing or eliminating the need to maintain outside banking relationships. Notable exchanges that utilize the token include \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/organization/bitfinex\"\u003eBitfinex\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/organization/bittrex\"\u003eBittrex\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/organization/binance-holdings-ltd\"\u003eBinance\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/organization/coinbase\"\u003eCoinbase\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/organization/kraken\"\u003eKraken\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/organization/huobi\"\u003eHuobi\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/organization/poloniex\"\u003ePoloniex\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/organization/liquid\"\u003eLiquid.io\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/organization/gate-io\"\u003eGate.io\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/organization/okex\"\u003eOKEx\u003c/a\u003e. Tether Ltd shares many executives and has strong ties with Hong Kong based Bitfinex with both sharing the same parent organization \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/organization/ifinex-inc\"\u003eiFinex Inc\u003c/a\u003e.\n\nSince its founding in 2014, Tether has been the \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/history-of-tether\"\u003esubject of ongoing controversy \u003c/a\u003edue to the failure of Tether to provided audited financial statements proving it has adequate reserves backing USDT. Historically Tether has failed to disclose its banking relationships, only recently announcing its banking partners in November 2018 to quell rumors about its solvency raised by associated crypto exchange, Bitfinex.\n\nIn March 2019, Tether updated its disclosure statement claiming that its tokens are no longer backed 100% by U.S. dollar deposits. Tether is instead now backed 100% backed by reserves, which include traditional currency and cash equivalents and, from time to time, other assets and receivables from loans made by Tether to third parties, which may include affiliated entities.

            "background_details": "Cardano is an open-source blockchain originating from peer-reviewed academic research. Cardano does not have a single published white paper but is developed from a collection of academic papers. Cardano sees itself as a “third-generation” protocol, improving on Bitcoin and Ethereum as the first and second generations, respectively. Cardano is named after an Italian Renaissance mathematician, Gerolamo Cardano, and its native currency ADA is named after Ada Lovelace, a 19th-century mathematician sometimes referenced as the first computer programmer. \n\nCardano is backed by three entities: IOHK, The Cardano Foundation, and Emurgo. IOHK is a blockchain research and development company founded by Charles Hoskinson and Jeremy Wood that is contracted to work on Cardano from 2015 through 2020. The Cardano Foundation is a non-profit organization focused on core development and ecosystem growth for Cardano. Emurgo is a Japanese venture capital firm. \n\nCardano's full launch will consist of five phases: Byron, Shelley, Goguen, Basho, and Voltaire. The Byron era arrived in September 2017 with the mainnet launch of the Cardano blockchain. During this phase, the chain operated as a federated network that only supported ADA transactions. The next phase, Shelley, launched in July 2020, bringing Cardano's proposed Ouroboros Proas Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocol to life. It's now in the process of rolling out its third phase, Goguen, which will add support for smart contracts and native token issuance. Cardano development teams, IOHK and Emurgo, are researching and building the network's remaining phases, Basho and Voltaire, in parallel with Goguen.",

Therefore, any block rewards generated during this initial phase were burned (no inflation during Byron). \n\nThe Byron era also saw the delivery of the Daedalus wallet, IOHK's official desktop wallet for ADA, as well as Yoroi, a light wallet built by Emurgo for quick transactions and day-to-day use."

Cardano plans to release a Shelley mainnet candidate chain around Jun. 23 before releasing the code to mainnet on the Jun. 30 target date. The official hard fork that will activate Shelley’s changes could arrive on Jul. 29, which would give network participants enough time to upgrade their nodes and wallets.

Goguen will also introduce Marlowe, a domain-specific language (DSL) for financial contracts built on Plutus. Marlowe and Plutus combined will enable developers to create Cardano-based tokens, such as native fungible or non-fungible tokens or the tokenization of external digital or physical assets (e.g., equity, commodities, real estates, etc.)."

Sidechains are new blockchains (like shard chains) that interoperate with the main chain. They can help off-load work from this base layer to increase the overall capacity of the network (scalability through parallel computation). While Cardano uses a UTXO model, sidechains will also have the ability to support account-based models. By having parallel accounting styles, Cardano might be able to interoperate with external networks more easily or support new kinds of uses cases."

Token holders, either through direct staking or a delegation system, will then be able to vote on which proposals the network should implement. Voltaire will also see the addition of a treasury system, whereby a fraction of all transaction fees will be pooled to provide funds for development activities undertaken following the voting process."

Ouroboros consensus aims for improved network security and modularized design. Cardano’s modularization allows for network delegation, sidechains, and light client data structures.\n\nOuroboros design\nOuroboros consensus is determined by slot leaders who are elected by token holders with a sufficient stake in the network. Slot leaders operate in epochs to listen for and confirm transactions to produce blocks, which are then approved by input endorsers. A Cardano input endorser is the second set of stakeholders that verifies transactions included in blocks. Cardano believes this design is scalable since the network can increase the number of slots per epoch and run multiple epochs across the network simultaneously.",

In blockchains like Bitcoin and Etheruem, one of the limitations to scalability is the time required to reach a consensus on the order of transactions. Anatoly believed his new technique could automate the transaction ordering process for blockchains, providing a key piece that would enable crypto networks to scale well-beyond their capabilities at the time.\n\nAnatoly later teamed up with former Qualcomm colleague Greg Fitzgerald to build a single blockchain network in Rust that used PoH as its \"internal clock.\" The two released the first internal testnet (with demo) and official version of the project's whitepaper in Feb. 2018. Another former Qualcomm cohort, Stephen Akridge, suggested that offloading signature verification to graphics processors could further increase transaction throughput (i.e., scalability). Anatoly recruited Greg and Stephen, and three others to found the company that would eventually become Solana Labs. The founding team included former Apple engineers in addition to the Qualcomm veterans. They initially named the project Loom but later rebranded it to Solana to avoid confusion with the Ethereum Layer-2 scaling solution, Loom Network.\n\nSolana Labs began raising funds to build its new crypto network in Q2 2018. Between Apr. 2018 and Jul. 2019, the team raised a little over $20 million in various private token sales. They announced the sales as a single Series A in late-July 2019. The fundraising effort ran parallel to Solana's work on the protocol, which went through several permissioned testnet phases before the team announced its public incentivized testnet, called Tour de SOL, in Q3 2020. The first stage of Tour de SOL went live in Feb. 2020, and it continues to run alongside the Mainnet Beta version of Solana today.\n\nSolana launched on Mainnet Beta in Mar. 2020, shortly after raising $1.76 million in a public token auction hosted on CoinList. The project's beta network featured basic transaction capabilities and smart contract support. But it did not include any staking rewards as Solana was still determining its ongoing issuance schedule. The current plan is to upgrade from its current beta stage to a more production-ready version in either later 2020 or early 2021.\n\nAt the moment, Solana Labs remains a core contributor to the Solana network, while the Solana Foundation helps fund ongoing development and community building efforts.",

The tokens issued in these sales should become liquid around Jan. 7, 2021. The project's public auction sale (held in Mar. 2020) did not come with a lockup schedule, and the SOL tokens distributed in that sale (which totaled 1.6% of the initial supply) were fully liquid once the network launched.\n\nThe founder's allocation (12.5% of the initial supply) will also be subject to a nine-month lockup post-network launch. After the lockup period ends, these tokens will vest monthly for another two years (expected to fully vest by Jan. 2023).\n\nThe Grant Pool and Community Reserve (both overseen by the Solana Foundation) contain ~38% of the initial SOL supply combined. These allocations began to vest in small amounts since Solana's mainnet launch. One million Grant Pool tokens vested every three months for the first nine months, and 35 million Community Reserve tokens vested in 5 million token increments over the same timeframe. The entire allocations for these categories will unlock in Jan. 2021.\n\nThe Solana Foundation's allocation began vesting in small increments every month following the network's launch. The foundation also unlocked 11,365,067 SOL at launch to lend to a market maker for six months. After disclosing this information to SOL holders, the team opted to burn an equivalent amount of tokens from the foundation's allocation.\n\nOngoing Emissions\nSolana validators voted to enable \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/61adff26-b903-4ab9-8329-952d6a555228\"\u003e\"pico-inflation\"\u003c/a\u003e on Dec. 24, 2020. The SOL supply is now inflating at an annual rate of 0.1%, with newly minted tokens going to validators and stakers in proportion to their staked amounts. This relatively low inflation rate is only temporary and will be replaced by a more substantial and permanent inflation proposal at some point in 2021.\n\nThis \"final\" inflation proposal includes an initial annual inflation rate of 8%. However, this inflation rate will decrease at an annual rate of 15% (\"dis-inflation rate\"). Solana's inflation rate will continue to decrease until it reaches an annual rate of 1.5%, which the network should reach in about ten years or 2031. 1.5% will remain the long-term inflation rate for Solana unless the network's governance system votes to change it.",

The current network setting has around 400 milliseconds (ms) for one slot. Every 400ms, the network has a potential rollback point, but every subsequent vote doubles the amount of time that the network would have to stall before it can unroll that vote. In short, secondary votes make it much harder to undo the transactions executed in a particular slot. Therefore, a block with several votes has a greater chance of remaining a part of the chain permanently.\n\nAs an example, each validator has voted 32 times in the last 12 seconds. The vote 12 seconds ago now will have a timeout of 2³² slots or roughly 54 years. Effectively, this vote will never be rolled back by the network. Whereas the most recent vote has a timeout of two slots or about 800ms. As new blocks are added to the ledger, old blocks are increasingly likely to be confirmed because the number of slots old votes is committed to doubles every slot. Tower BTF offers finality once two-thirds of network validators have voted on some order of events. Once transactions are finalized, they can't be rolled back.\n\nThe Solana mainnet is planned to operate in delegated-Proof-of-Stake (dPoS), in which token holders can participate in the block production process and earn rewards by either stake token and become a validator themselves, or delegate their tokens to validators they trust.\n\nAny individual can become a validator on the network and contribute to the overall security of the protocol. There is no minimum staking requirement, although the leader selection process (which validator gets to propose the next block) is stake-weighted. The network architecture is designed to scale with bandwidth and hardware, utilizing GPU cores to parallelize execution and reduce verification times. Due to the GPU requirement, hardware expectations are slightly higher than some protocols. Estimated costs for a satisfactory setup are around $5,000.",

          "overview": {
            "technology_details": "Solana’s highly performant blockchain is built using the eight innovations:\nProof of History: A clock before consensus\nTower BFT: A PoH-optimized version of PBFT\nTurbine: A block propagation protocol\nGulfstream: Mempool-less transaction forwarding protocol\nSealevel: World’s first parallel smart contracts run-time\nPipelining: Transaction processing unit for validation\nCloudbreak: Horizontally-scaled accounts database\nArchivers: Distributed ledger storage\n\nProof of History: A clock before consensus\nThe biggest challenge in distributed networks is agreeing on the time and sequence in which events occurred as nodes within the network can’t trust the timestamp on messages received from other nodes. Solana attempts to solve this with Proof of History (PoH) by creating a cryptographically secure source of time across the network. Proof of History is a high-frequency Verifiable Delay Function (VDF), which requires a specific number of sequential steps to evaluate but produces a unique output that can be publicly verified. This means that nodes can create the next block without having to coordinate with the entire network first because they can trust the timestamp and ordering of the messages that they’ve received. The result is a reduction in consensus overhead.\n\nTower BFT: A PoH-optimized version of PBFT\nOn top of Proof of History, Solana runs its consensus mechanism called Tower BFT, which is a PBFT-like algorithm that leverages the synchronized clock enabled by PoH to achieve consensus on network transactions. At a high level, each time a node on the network votes on a particular fork, they commit to a certain amount of time where they are locked out from voting on an opposing fork. This period where they are locked out grows exponentially as they continue to vote on the same fork until they achieve a maximum lockout at 32 votes for the same fork. Nodes on the network will only receive inflation rewards when they reach this maximum vote lockout; therefore, it is in their interest to continue voting on the fork they believe the supermajority of the network is voting for.\n\nTurbine: A block propagation protocol\nSolana transmits blocks (communicates blocks between validators) independently of consensus, using a separate but connected protocol called Turbine. Turbine borrows heavily from BitTorrent and is optimized for streaming. As a block is streamed, it is broken up into small packets along with erasure codes, and then fanned out across a large set of random peers.\n\nGulf Stream: Mempool-less transaction forwarding protocol\nIn a high-performance network, mempool management presents a new class of problems when it comes to the cost of filtering and maintaining a rising number of unconfirmed transactions. Gulf Stream functions by pushing transaction caching and forwarding to the edge of the network. Since every validator knows the order of upcoming leaders (block producers) in Solana architecture, clients and validators forward transactions to the expected leader ahead of time. This allows validators to execute transactions ahead of time, reduce confirmation times, switch leaders faster, and reduce the memory pressure on validators from the unconfirmed transaction pool. One consequence of knowing leaders ahead of time is an increased risk of validator collusion since the network allows more time for them to coordinate. Solana's fast block times might mitigate the opportunity for collusion because it limits the time allowed to plan an attack. \n\nSealevel: Parallel smart contracts run-time\nSolana built Sealevel, a hyper parallelized transaction processing engine designed to scale horizontally across GPUs and SSDs. Most other blockchains are single-threaded computers. In contrast, Solana can support parallel transaction execution (in addition to signature verification) in a single shard. The solution to this problem borrows heavily from an operating system driver technique called scatter-gather. Transactions specify upfront what state they will read and write while executing. Sealevel is able to find the non-overlapping transactions occurring in a block and execute them in parallel (called parallel execution) while optimizing how read and writes to the state are scheduled across an array of RAID 0 SSDs. Sealevel is a VM that schedules transactions, but it doesn’t actually execute transactions in the VM. Instead, Sealevel hands off transactions to be executed on hardware natively using bytecode called the Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF).\n\nPipeline: A Transaction Processing Unit for validation optimization\nThe process of transaction validation on the Solana network makes extensive use of an optimization common in CPU design called pipelining. Pipelining is an appropriate process when there’s a stream of input data that needs to be processed by a sequence of steps and there’s different hardware responsible for each step. On the Solana network, the pipeline mechanism, the Transaction Processing Unit (TPU), progresses through Data Fetching at the kernel level, Signature Verification at the GPU level, Banking at the CPU level, and Writing at the kernel space. By the time the TPU starts to send blocks out to the validators, it’s already fetched in the next set of packets, verified their signatures, and begun crediting tokens. The GPU parallelization in this four-stage pipeline allows the Solana TPU to operate at a high performance.\n\nCloudbreak: Horizontally-scaled accounts database\nMethods to scale computation using these other innovations could result in memory bottlenecks. Memory is used to keep track of accounts and can struggle to maintain performance due to a lack of memory size and limited access speeds. Cloudbreak was designed to optimize for concurrent reads and writes spread across a RAID 0 configuration of SSDs. Each additional disk adds storage capacity available to on-chain programs, while also increasing the number of concurrent reads and writes programs can perform when executing. This goes hand in hand with Solana’s transaction design, allowing for pre-fetching accounts from disk and preparing the runtime for execution, also enabling nodes on the network to begin executing transactions before they are encoded into a block. All of this aims to help reduces block times and confirmation latency on the network.\n\nArchivers: Distributed ledger storage\nStoring and maintaining data on a high-performance network is likely to become a primary centralization vector. If storage costs are very high, only well-funded entities will be able to act as validators and participate in consensus. On Solana, data storage is offloaded from validators to a network of nodes called Archivers. Archivers do not participate in consensus. The history of the state is broken into many pieces and erasure codes. Archivers store small parts of the state. Every so often, the network will ask the Archivers to prove that they’re storing the data they are supposed to. Solana leverages Proofs of Replication (PoRep), which are borrowed heavily from Filecoin. Archivers are not currently implemented and are on the long term roadmap. They will be rolled out based on network data demands.",

            "background_details": "Founded in 2012 by \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/chris-larsen\"\u003eChris Larsen\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/jed-mccaleb\"\u003eJed McCaleb\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/organization/ripple\"\u003eRipple\u003c/a\u003e (Formerly known as Opencoin) is a technology company that develops the Ripple payment protocol. Ripple enables banks, payment providers, digital asset exchanges, and corporations to send money globally using blockchain technology. Leveraging the prior work of \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/ryan-fugger\"\u003eRyan Fugger\u003c/a\u003e, in 2012 Ripple created the XRP Ledger (formerly known as Ripple Consensus Ledger), an open-source cryptographic ledger powered by a peer-to-peer network of nodes. XRP is the native asset of the XRP ledger.\n\nIn 2004, Ryan Fugger founded RipplePay, a financial technology company aiming to create a peer-to-peer payments network. Separately, in 2011, a team of Jed McCaleb began the development of a new consensus network for digital currencies that would ultimately become the XRP Ledger. Later Chris Larsen, \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/david-schwartz\"\u003eDavid Schwartz\u003c/a\u003e, and Arthur Britto, would join the project, and in 2012 McCaleb and Larsen approached Ryan about RipplePay. After discussion with the RipplePay community Ryan handed over the project to McCaleb and Larsen, and in September 2012 they founded Opencoin (re-branded to Ripple Labs in 2013). \n\nIn 2013 Ripple released XRP, a native token on the Ripple Consensus Ledger. At launch, it created 100 billion XRP tokens of which 80 billion tokens were allocated to the company and 20 billion were given to the three founders. Over the course of 2013, Ripple would raise over $7.5 million from some of the most prestigious venture firms in the united states. Later that year Jed McCaleb would leave the company over internal disputes around the company's vision and would ultimately go on to found Stellar.\n\nAfter the initial release of the XRP Ledger, Ripple focused its efforts on getting financial institutions to use the ledger to process remittances. Entering the cross border payments market led to regulatory scrutiny, with FinCEN fining Ripple Inc for violating the bank secrecy act in 2015. As part of the remedial plan related to the fine, Ripple Inc agreed to enhance the anti-money laundering capabilities of the XRP protocol and stricter permissioning requirements were added for additional participants to join the network.\n\nTo further enhance the credibility of XRP as a partner for traditional financial institutions, Ripple obtained a \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/bitlicense\"\u003eBitLicense\u003c/a\u003e from the State of New York in 2016. The upside of these enhancements and engagement with regulators was it gave XRP the capability to more deeply integrate with the traditional financial system. \n\nToday XRP's primary use is as a bridge currency underpinning \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/organization/ripple\"\u003eRipple\u003c/a\u003e's xRapid product, an on-demand liquidity solution. xRapid allows financial institutions to exchange value between fiat currencies through a network a digital asset exchanges that use XRP as a bridge currency for its liquidity.\n\nTo date Ripple has raised over $120 million in venture funding, and XRP is one of the largest cryptocurrencies in the world by market capitalization. Ripple and its founding team own the substantial majority of the XRP supply of which Ripple the company programmatically sells on a quarterly basis. Since 2016 Ripple has sold over $1.1 billion worth of XRP and XRP sales remain Ripple's dominant source of revenue (and controversy).\n\n",

              "supply_curve_details": "XRP outstanding supplied is designed to be deflationary. XRP is burned to pay fees for transactions via Ripplenet. Nevertheless, XRP liquid and circulating supply are massively inflationary. \n\nIn December 2017, Ripple placed 55 billion XRP into escrow in order to alleviate concerns that a massive amount of XRP could hit the market all at once with substantial negative price impact. 1 billion is being released monthly to support Ripple’s ongoing operation of Ripplenet. Any unused funds are returned to escrow at the end of the month. On average Ripple re-escrows 700 million and 300 million XRP become liquid each month.\n\nRipple generated revenue from ongoing XRP sales, which account for well over 90% of the company's revenue. There are two types of XRP sales that the company discloses:\nProgrammatic sales: These come from the company’s XRP reserve, and can be sold at a rate of no more than 0.25% of average daily volume on defined exchanges. \nDirect sales from XRP II: These come from direct bespoke deals with institutional clients, and include (per Ripple’s 2016-2017 disclosures) reselling restrictions to ensure its partners do not purchase XRP at a discount from the company and then immediately flood the market with sales.\n\nRipple has sold over 1.2 billion USD worth of XRP through Direct Sales and Programmatic Sales. \n\nOur liquid supply curve takes into account the Ripple Escrow mechanism as well as the Founder' selling agreement to calculate liquid supply. As such, even though XRP's outstanding supply is deflationary over time through fee-burning, circulating and liquid supply are massively inflationary due to escrow release, founder's distributions, and Ripple sales. At the current burn rate, it would take 20 years for the XRP Ledger to burn what is distributed by Ripple and its founders every day. \n\nTo date, Messari released to in-depth research on Ripple supply management:\n\u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/xrp-market-cap-may-be-6-1-billion-overstated\"\u003eXRP Market Cap may be $6.1 billion overstated\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/messari-research-circulating-supply-study-for-xrp\"\u003eCirculating Supply Study for XRP\u003c/a\u003e",

This process occurs until a supermajority (80%) of UNL nodes have matching ledgers. Once a supermajority is reached, each server independently computes a new ledger hash from the agreed-upon set of transactions and compares results. Once a supermajority (80%) of validators agree upon the hash of the new ledger candidate, the ledger candidate is considered final.",

            "technology_details": "XRP's foundation is a shared public ledger used by network participants to exchange value globally. A supermajority of validators is required for the network to arrive at consensus to validate transactions initiated across the network.\n\nRipple Inc, has focused on integrating user verification protocols so network participants are able to define which users they trust and how much they trust them. This has the effect of causing transactions to “ripple” across the network. Because if two users without a direct relationship initiate a transaction across the network. It ripples outward finding a path linking the users together from their trusted relationships to complete the transaction. \n\nFor users just getting started, Ripple Inc. maintains a unique node list users can select by default representing validators with a history of reliably operating on the XRP network.\n\nCross-currency transactions typically take 3 – 5 seconds to process across the ledger. Once initiated, XRP’s pathfinding algorithm identifies the quickest least expensive way to complete the transaction. Generally, for the pathfinding algorithm to work optimally, a large number of market makers need to be operating on the network so sufficient liquidity is available to efficiently complete transactions.\n\nTo encourage the development of a robust ecosystem around the ledger, XRP maintains a variety of APIs to help nodes and other third parties interact with it based on the REST API standard. Invoicing and wallet solutions allow businesses to incorporate it as a payment option for their customers.\n",

Only the votes of the other members of the UNL are considered when determining consensus, giving Ripple the ability to significantly influence who gets to participate in consensus and who does not. Furthermore, Ripple also participates at the network level of the XRP Ledger, validating transactions. ",

Polkadot refers to the entire ecosystem of parachains that plug into a single base platform known as the Relay Chain.

          "background": {
            "background_details": "Polkadot origins\nPolkadot is the brainchild of Dr. Gavin Wood, who is one of the co-founders of Ethereum and the inventor of the Solidity smart contract language. Dr. Wood started working on his idea to “design a sharded version of Ethereum” in mid-2016 and released the first draft of the Polkadot white paper in Oct. 2016.\n\nIn 2017, Dr. Wood and Parity’s Peter Czaban founded the Web3 Foundation, a non-profit entity established to support the research and development of Polkadot as well as to oversee its fundraising efforts. The Switzerland-based Web3 Foundation hosted Polkadot’s first token sale in Oct. 2017, using a Spend-All Second Price Dutch Auction to distribute the funds. The sale raised $145 million in just under two weeks, selling 50% of the initial 10 million DOT (old) supply, and the Web3 Foundation chose Parity Technologies to develop Polkadot.\n\nParity Technologies was founded by Dr. Wood and Jutta Steiner and is known for maintaining the Parity Ethereum client in addition to Substrate, which serves as the development framework for Polkadot.\n\nParity Wallet hack and subsequent fundraising efforts\nTen days after the token sale ended (Nov. 6, 2017), someone permanently froze the funds in the Parity multisig contract (the second such incident in a matter of months) compromising a little over $90 million worth of ETH equaling around 66% of Polkadot’s token sale proceeds. Polkadot, along with Parity, has petitioned the Ethereum community to consider finding a way to return to the funds, but the situation remains unresolved. Despite the lost funds, Polkadot and Web3 Foundation reported the project still had enough funds to meet its development milestones.\n\nThe Web3 Foundation reportedly raised more capital to replenish the lost funds in a 2019 private token sale. In the sale, Polkadot sought to sell 500,000 DOT (old) tokens at a $1.2 billion valuation, pricing the tokens at $120 apiece. Although the foundation did not disclose any details related to the raise, it was reported that the sale closed in June 2019 at a “successful” valuation.\n\nPolkadot technical developments and mainnet rollout\nOn the technical front, Polkadot started rolling out various proofs-of-concept (PoCs) in May 2018 to test its base relay chain, the relay chain’s support for parachains, and its finality agent (dubbed GRANDPA). PoC 3, released in Jan. 2019, also introduced the Alexander testnet, Polkadot’s first test network. But the project’s first significant release came in Aug. 2019 with the public launch of Kusama. Kusama is an early, unaudited, and unrefined release of Polkadot, designed to serve as a \"canary\" network for Polkadot to test governance, staking, and sharding under real economic conditions. Polkadot also dedicated 1% of the initial DOT supply to Kusama stakeholders in order to encourage participation.\n\nPolkadot adopted a staged rollout strategy for its mainnet launch. Polkadot's first mainnet chain candidate, Phase 1, launched on \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/polkadot-goes-live-with-the-release-of-its-first-mainnet-chain-candidate\"\u003eMay 27, 2020\u003c/a\u003e. It marked the initial step in a multi-stage rollout process detailed in the project's mainnet launch roadmap. This early version of Polkadot operated as Proof-of-Authority (PoA) network managed by six validators belonging to the Web3 Foundation. Eventually, the network transitioned to its proposed Nominated Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system on Jun. 18, 2020 (Phase 2), which enabled DOT owners to claim validators slots and unlocked staking rewards. Phases 3 and 4 in late Jul. 2020 introduced Polkadot's governance functionality and handing control of the protocol over to the community, respectively. The final phase plans to unlock DOT token transfers on Aug. 18, 2020.\n\nThe Web3 Foundation continues to use the proceeds from DOT sales to fund ecosystem initiatives and back projects building on Polkadot (see: the \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/polychain-web3-foundation-start-a-fund-to-back-projects-building-on-polkadot\"\u003ePolkadot Ecosystem Fund\u003c/a\u003e). The foundation is governed by the Foundation Council, a governing body consisting of Dr. Gavin Wood (President and Founder), Dr. Aeron Buchanan (Vice President), and Reto Trinkler.\n\nDOT redenomination\nIn the first official community vote for the network, Polkadot token holders voted to change the denomination between DOT and its smallest unit, Plancks, by a factor of 100. This change officially went into effect at block #1,248,328, which arrived on Aug. 21, 2020, about 72 hours after DOT transfers unlocked at block #1,205,128  (Aug. 18, 2020).\n\nIt was a cosmetic change that was similar to a stock split. The token balances of each Polkadot account increased by 100x, increasing the total DOT supply from its original 10 million to 1 billion. But the move did not impact Polkadot’s pre-market valuation as the dollar amount of each DOT will decrease by 100x.",

When messages are sent between two blockchains on the network, DOT's are used to pay for fees. DOT holders are also responsible for managing significant events by voting on protocol upgrades and fixes. The token also ensures that network participants act in a manner that does not damage the network by giving them skin in the game. In order to create new parachains, tokens must be bonded ensuring incentive alignment.\n\nHow to stake DOTs\nWhile validators on Polkadot need to maintain the (often expensive) hardware necessary to secure the network, anyone can assume the role of a nominator by bonding their DOTs to a dedicated validator. Bonding tokens helps increase the network’s cost of attack and allows DOT holders to earn newly minted tokens as staking rewards. Polkadot is targeting about a 75% stake rate, which at a 10% inflation rate in the network’s inaugural year, would provide an annual staking return of~20%. Bonded tokens will remain locked for twelve weeks and are subject to slashing (loss of funds) should the chosen validator go offline or misbehave.\n\nPolkadot Wallet\nThere are multiple teams working on Polkadot wallet implementations prior to network launch. Most notably, blockchain.com announced that it will integrate DOT tokens into its wallet allowing users to store, send and receive tokens as well as participate in governance by voting on proposals."

Participants were required to use a KYC system called PICOPS, which verifies the identity of each participant. Participants that were unable to verify themselves were deemed ineligible. The sale was also not available to any Chinese or American citizens due to regulatory concerns. \n\nAt the start of the network, a total of 10 million DOT (old) will be created as a native token. The initial supply was later redenominated by a community vote, a cosmetic change that increased token account balances by 100x. The following allocations are the same for both DOT (old) and new DOT:\n\n50% allocated to token sale investors\n5% allocated to the 2019 private sale investors\n3.4% allocated to 2020 token sale investors\n11.6% retained by the Foundation for future fundraising efforts\n30% allocated to the Web 3 Foundation for immediate use to develop the Polkadot network and other undisclosed Foundation activities.\n\nThe total supply is not fixed at 1 billion but instead will use a to be determined inflationary model to supply the rewards for the proof-of-stake (\u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/proof-of-stake\"\u003ePoS\u003c/a\u003e) system. \n\nOn Nov. 6, 2017, a vulnerability was exploited in the Parity multi-sig wallet containing over 500,000 ETH, including $98 million of the $140 million+ in ETH raised through the Polkadot ICO. These funds are currently frozen, and a debate among the Ethereum community will determine whether these funds can or will ever be recovered. Even if the funds are lost, the Parity team does not believe this will impact their development roadmap.\n\nIn Jun. 2019, The Web3 Foundation announced it sold another 500,000 DOT (old) tokens (now 50 million new DOT) to an undisclosed group of private investors. Based on previous reports from Polkadot, the project was seeking to raise $60 million at a $1.2 billion valuation through this token sale. The Jun. 2019 announcement declared the raise successful, implying the Polkadot reached its target."

              "consensus_details": "Polkadot uses what it calls a hybrid consensus, which separates finality from the block production mechanism. At a high level, Polkadot allows the network to produce blocks at a rapid pace while permitting the slower finality agent to run in a separate process, thereby not affecting transaction execution times. This design theoretically helps overcome the issues associated with probabilistic finality, namely the chance of unknowingly following an incorrect fork or the inability to produce new blocks (aka stalling).\n\nThe two mechanisms that power Polkadot’s consensus include:\nBABE: The Blind Assignment for Blockchain Extension (BABE) is the block production mechanism. It assigns block production slots to randomly selected validators according to stake (as defined by the Polkadot randomness cycle).\nGRANDPA: The GHOST-based Recursive ANcestor Deriving Prefix Agreement (GRANDPA) is the finality gadget for the Polkadot relay chain. This agent reaches agreements on chains rather than blocks, which could speed up the finalization process. Polkadot helps elaborate on this definition by stating if “more than 2/3 of validators attest to a chain containing a certain block, all blocks leading up to that one are finalized at once.”\n\nWhile the core technology of Polkadot is the relay chain, the network reaches consensus through a modified and proprietary PoS mechanism consisting of four key participants: collators, validators, nominators, and fishermen.\n\nCollator\nEach parachain has a collator that fulfills the task of a miner in a \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/proof-of-work\"\u003eproof-of-work\u003c/a\u003e (PoW) blockchain. A collator must maintain the Polkadot relay chain state as well as the state of the parachain. The collator then manages the queue of transactions going into and out of the parachain from the relay chain. Collators collect parachain transactions, produce state transition proofs, create new candidate blocks and then pass them along to validators in exchange for a fee for their work. In a competitive market with many collators, collators can incentivize validators to choose their block by sharing a portion of their fee with the validator.\n\nValidators\nValidators are randomly nominated to accept block candidates from parachain collators, verify the information in the block, and republish the block candidate to the Polkadot relay chain. Once a validator confirms a block, they also validate and change the state of the relay chain block by moving the transaction data from the originating parachain’s input queue to the destination parachain’s output queue. Validators are incentivized through a staking mechanism that requires them to stake Polkadot (DOT) tokens to the network to be chosen as an active validator. Validators that break the consensus algorithm are punished by losing a portion of their stake, while those that correctly secure the network and verify blocks are rewarded with new tokens.\n\nNominators\nNominators are those who may be unable to participate in the transaction validation process directly, so they instead contribute tokens to a validator of their choice. Nominators receive a pro-rata share of the validator reward based on their portion of the validator’s bond, so nominators are incentivized to choose a validator most likely to receive the largest reward. The team believes the nominator process will create a competitive, but honest, marketplace for high-quality validators and nominators.\n\nFishermen\nFishermen do not participate in the transaction validation process with validators and nominators, but instead, act as watchmen monitoring activity across the Polkadot network and identify validators who break consensus rules. Fishermen stake a smaller bond of tokens than a validator but receive a proportionally larger reward than validators for their role in securing the network.",

            "technology_details": "Polkadot features a variety of technical components, including the relay-chain, parachains, the Polkadot Runtime Environment (PRE), and cross-network bridges.\n\nRelay-chain\nPolkadot's relay-chain is built with Substrate, a blockchain building framework that is the distillation of Parity technologies learnings building Ethereum, Bitcoin, and enterprise blockchains. It is at the core of the network, helping map addresses to account information, coordinating communications, and providing consensus through a pooled security mechanism utilizing proof-of-stake (PoS). All validators stake their DOTs and produced blocks directly on the relay-chain.\n\nThe relay chain lacks features like smart contracts and instead is designed to be a minimal protocol to connect other network participants and provide transaction finality. Since this central chain is handling the bulk of the network’s transaction flows, actions on the relay-chain may come at a premium. But the relay-chain will delegate a significant portion of the computational work to the surrounding parachains, which can have “differing implementations and features.”\n\nParachains\nParachains will be used to collect and process transactions while using the relay chain for finality. To increase transaction throughput, parachains will process transactions concurrently across multiple chains, instead of queuing transactions and processing them sequentially.\n\nPolkadot does not place any constraints on the design and structure of parachains. These network components can be application-specific or support a particular feature (e.g., privacy or scalability). But each parachain must generate a proof regularly so a designated Polkadot validator can verify and reconcile past transactions. Parachains also share the same state as the relay-chain, meaning if the relay-chain should revert at any point, then all parachains would revert as well. In terms of composability, cross-parachain communication is native to Polkadot. Therefore, parachains will be able to send messages (including transactions and data) to each other “without the need for smart contracts to perform the bridging functionality.”\n\nPolkadot Runtime Environment (PRE)\nThe PRE consists of the networking, consensus and WebAssembly Virtual Machine subsystems. Polkadot breaks the components of the PRE down to:\nNetwork Interactions\nState storage and the Storage Trie\nConsensus Engine\nWasm Virtual Machine (VM)\n\nPolkadot’s state machine is compiled to WebAssembly (WASM), a high-performance virtual environment. WASM is developed by major companies including Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Mozilla, that have created a large ecosystem of support for the standard. Polkadot's networking uses libp2p, a cross-platform network framework for peer-to-peer applications that handles the peer discovery and communication in the Polkadot ecosystem. The Polkadot runtime environment is being coded in C++, and Golang to make Polkadot accessible to a wider range of developers.\n\nBridging\nPolkadot will eventually enable the connections to outside networks like Ethereum and Bitcoin through a series of specialized bridge contracts or modules. There are two different types of external bridging in Polkadot:\nBridge contracts: Smart contracts that connect Polkadot’s relay-chain to external chains (for example, the Parity Bridge between an Ethereum Proof-of-Authority (\u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/proof-of-authority\"\u003ePoA\u003c/a\u003e) sidechain to a Substrate-based chain)\nIn-built bridging modules: Purpose-built modules that help external chains connect with Polkadot",

This governance system remained intact through Polkadot's mainnet launch and early existence. In late Jul. 2020, control over the protocol was transferred to the network's proposed on-chain governance system, which takes into consideration token holders, validators, a Council, and a Technical Committee. These network participants are now the primary source of upgrade submissions and approvals. Parity and Web3 can still develop and submit proposals of their own, but they must pass through the governance system before being implemented.",

            "onchain_governance_type": "Delegated On-Chain Vote",
            "onchain_governance_details": "Polkadot’s future on-chain governance system that hands the future direction of the protocol over to a technical council, an on-chain entity consisting of members voted in by network stakeholders. This system will allow active token holders and Council members to propose codebase changes by bonding a minimum amount of DOTs to the network to ensure some economic buy-in. Other token holders can also deposit an equivalent amount of tokens to the proposal to support it. The top proposals by stake amount are selected to be a referendum, which Polkadot defines as “inclusive, stake-based voting schemes.” Bonded tokens are returned once the proposal is brought to a vote. If the proposal originates within the Council, Council members can approve the raw submission internally and move the proposal to a referendum.\n\nEvery 30 days, a new referendum is brought to a vote, with separate queues for Council and public submissions. To vote, token holders must lock up their tokens “for at least the enactment delay period,” which could stretch beyond the end of the referendum, to ensure economic buy-in and discourage vote selling.\n\nWhat determines if the proposal passes the vote depends on which entity proposed the referendum. Polkadot references [three possible scenarios](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-governance#tallying):\n- If a public submission, Positive Turnout Bias (Super-Majority Approve)\n- If a Council submission that reaches a “Complete agreement,” Negative Turnout Bias (Super-Majority Against)\n- If a Council submission that reaches a “Majority agreement,” Simple Majority\n\nAt genesis, the [Council](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-governance#council) began with thirteen members, represented as on-chain accounts. There are plans to increase this total over the following nine months to a max of 24. DOT holders vote these representatives into their privileged positions via a network-wide election process. All members have a fixed term of one year, although any representative can be removed early via a referendum. Network participants rely on the Council for two primary tasks: proposing new referenda and canceling possibly malicious proposals. Members must reach a unanimous agreement to carry out a referendum cancellation.\n\nPolkadot also employs a [Technical Committee](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-governance#technical-committee), first introduced in the Kusama rollout, as one of the three chambers of its governance system. Committee representatives consist of teams that previously “implemented or specified either Polkadot/Kusama runtime or the runtime environment.” The Council has the power to either add or remove Technical Committee teams by a simple majority vote. The committee’s sole purpose is to produce emergency referenda in the event of a dire situation. These proposals get fast-tracked for Council voting and implementation.\n\nThis governance design is in practice at the moment on the Kusama network. Its upgrade to CC3 on Nov. 28, 2019, unlocked its on-chain governance capabilities, enabling stakeholders to submit and vote on potential code changes. Through this process, Kusama participants already increased the network validator count beyond its base level and unlocked KSM token transfers.\n\nSee Kusama referenda [here](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/democracy) and the list of Kusama Council members [here](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/council).",

The project was introduced on Twitter by Jackson Palmer on November 27, 2013 when he tweeted about \"investing\" on “Dogecoin”, a made-up name. Some of Palmer's friends encouraged him to create a real Dogecoin project, so he registered dogecoin.com and started working. Billy Markus saw the website and reached out to Palmer. Markus and Palmer thought Dogecoin would make the cryptocurrency space more palletable to newcomers since, as they built the protocol, Bitcoin was beleaguered by associations with Silk Road and dark web. Palmer exited the Dogecoin project and community in June 2014 by tweeting, \"Unsubshibing. Peace.\"\n\nUnlike a variety of other altcoins launched in 2013 and 2014, Dogecoin has proved itself surprisingly resilient to crypto-asset market cycles, which is speculated to be the result of meme durability.

New blocks are added to the chain every 60 seconds, on average. \n\nDogecoin uses scrypt hash function for its proof-of-work consensus mechanism. The scrypt algorithm was specifically designed to make it costly to perform large-scale, custom-hardware attacks. At launch, Dogecoin was mine-able on personal computers, which was attractive to cryptocurrency enthusiasts during a time when Bitcoin mining was increasingly industrialized and capital intensive. \n\nDogecoin has no formal white paper, although several fans have written blog and forum posts as stand-in explainer documents.

The project was launched out of the insight that the industry needed a fiat-collateralized stablecoin with strong governance and transparency, in contrast to \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/tether\"\u003eTether\u003c/a\u003e. USDC attempts to solve these issues by publishing a monthly public attestation of 100% reserves of fiat tokens on CENTRE.io, and providing clear rules and guidelines for CENTRE members regarding USDC issuance and redemption. Furthermore to become an issuer within the CENTRE consortium members must follow key membership and operating rules which include licensing, compliance, technology \u0026 operations, accounting, and custody of fiat reserves.\n\nExchanges have been the primary users of USDC as an alternative to fiat currencies, outsourcing the need to maintain banking relationships. Furthermore, USDC is one of the only fiat-collateralized stablecoins available for use in the burgeoning \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/decentralized-finance-defi\"\u003eDeFi\u003c/a\u003e ecosystem.",

Customers who on-board through a stablecoin on-ramp, such as a web application created and maintained by a licensed CENTRE token-issuing member, can transfer fiat funds into that CENTRE issuer’s account. The issuer then executes a series of commands with the CENTRE network to verify, mint, and validate fiat tokens pegged to the value of those deposited funds. The customer can then transfer those tokens elsewhere in order to use them. Redemption follows the reverse sequence: fiat tokens are burned when a customer visits an off-ramp such as a web application maintained by a licensed CENTRE issuing member. Upon successful verification and validation, funds from underlying fiat reserves would be transferred to the customer’s external bank.\n",

            "background_details": "Terra was created in January 2018 with the singular vision of facilitating the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies by creating digitally native assets that are price-stable against the world's major fiat currencies. Keeping in mind that previous innovations in the technology of money was bootstrapped by large payment networks (Alipay with Taobao, Paypal with eBay, Visa with banks), Terra was born with the support of the Terra Alliance, 15 large e-commerce companies in Asia that collectively process 25 billion USD in annualized transaction volume and 45 million users. The vision of the project is that with the adoption and user engagement of a massive payment network, it will be able to, for the first time, bootstrap a blockchain payment network to the scale it deserves and facilitate far more powerful products and use cases through its infrastructure.  \n\nDuring conversations between co-founders, Daniel Shin and Do Kwon, the concept of Terra began as a solution towards immediate and massive usage of the cryptocurrency and blockchain infrastructure being built around them. To them, price stability and adoption were important in preparing the first steps towards massive adoption of cryptocurrency and blockchain infrastructure. Daniel Shin, with his extensive experience in building one of the biggest e-commerce platforms in Asia, laid out the existing problems we face in payment networks that cannot be solved through just incremental improvements. Do Kwon, previously a founder of a wireless mesh network startup building decentralized application, explained how Terra can turn those problems into an opportunity to build money from the ground up.  \n\nOne part of Terra's value contributions, payments, in essence replaces the complicated payments value chain, including credit card networks, banks, and payment gateways with a single blockchain layer. Through this, it can offer merchants a significantly cheaper transaction fee, saving them money that can be reinvested in something else. Further, in concert with the efficiencies that Terra has provided payment channels for both merchants and consumers, it continues to steadily provide infrastructural improvements and tools for the foundations of laying down a credibly neutral, distributed, and radically transparent ecosystem. Bolstered through the initial mass adoption of Terra's blockchain infrastructure powering its partner, CHAI, which has amassed over 1.3 million users to date, Terra moves naturally towards ecosystem building that offers competitive programmable payments, logistics, and infrastructure to power the plethora of industry that will be built on efficiency and scale.",

Terraform Labs also holds an additional 4.5% of the LUNA supply on behalf of investors who did not clear KYC in time for their token sale, and thus manually claim tokens for Terraform Labs rather than having their tokens programmatically vest from the genesis block.\n\nEmployees \u0026 Contributor Pool (20%): Used to compensate employees and contributors of the project. Some part of the coins have already been granted, and can be found in the accounts/employees directory. Currently 4.7% of this pool has been granted.  \n\nTerra Alliance (20%): The Terra Alliance is key to driving early adoption and usage for Terra. We will be using this pool to set incentives, mainly marketing discount programs (such as coupons for users) and volume incentives for alliance partners. Terraform Labs will be playing custodian for this pool, taking input from the community to best allocate resources from this pool.  \n\nStability Reserves (20%): Bootstrapping stablecoins is no easy feat, with threats to the peg coming from every adversarial angle. Stability reserves will be to manage the network's early stability close to genesis.  \n\nGenesis liquidity (4%): 4% of Luna will be made available to the market close to genesis to allow everyday users to use and interact with it.\n\nInvestors (26%):  \n\nIn order to finance the development of the Terra Project, Terraform Labs held three token sales:  \n\nSeed-sale: 16 cents per Luna, sold ~192M tokens. Lockup 10 - 18 months, with 30% early liquidity.\nPrivate-sale: 80 cents per Luna, sold ~18M tokens. Lockup 3 months, with 6 months linear vest thereafter.  \n\nTerra also minted 1 billion SDT (SDR stablecoin) at genesis. This SDT reserve exists to augment Terra's stability mechanism. Core to Terra's stability mechanism is the swapping of stablecoins to Luna - and while this is effective in normal conditions, when there is large changes in stablecoin demand in either direction the cost for the swap increases significantly: swap fees increase quadratically as one side of the fee is favored (and normalizes back over time), so in times of rapid demand change the fee goes up significantly, which makes it difficult to accommodate payment operations requiring a very tight spread. During times like this Terraform Labs swaps SDT to KRT and sells that for KRW to Chai. When Chai merchants settle out, Terraform Labs maintains that KRW in a fiat reserve to buy back KRT."

These validators participate in the consensus protocol by broadcasting votes which contain cryptographic signatures signed by each validator's private key.  \n\nValidator candidates can bond their own Luna and have Luna \"delegated\", or staked, to them by token holders. The Columbus Mainnet will have 100 validators, but over time this will increase to 300 validators according to a predefined schedule. The validators are determined by who has the most stake delegated to them — the top 100 validator candidates with the most stake will become Terra validators.  \n\nValidators and their delegators will earn the following fees:  * \n\nCompute fees: To prevent spamming, validators may set minimum gas fees for transactions to be included in their mempool. At the end of every block, the compute fees are disbursed to the participating validators pro-rata to stake.   \nStability fees: To stabilize the value of Luna, the protocol charges a small percentage transaction fee ranging from 0.1% to 1% on every Terra transaction, capped at 1 TerraSDR. This is paid in any Terra currency, and is disbursed pro-rata to stake at the end of every block in TerraSDR.   \nSeigniorage rewards: Validators that participate in the Exchange Rate Oracle get a portion of seigniorage if they faithfully report and win the ballot (vote within the reward band around the weighted median).  \n\nBesides revenue, there are scarcity incentives:*   \n\nSwap fees: A small spread is charged on atomic swap transactions between Luna and any Terra currency, which is burned and creates scarcity in Luna and indirectly rewards validators. Note that validators can set commission on the fees their delegators receive as additional incentive.  \n\nIf validators double sign, are frequently offline or do not participate in governance, their staked Luna (including Luna of users that delegated to them) can be slashed. The penalty depends on the severity of the violation.",

The Luna token is the native staking asset recognized by the Terra protocol and represents mining power, granting its staking validator access to transaction fees and miner rewards, allowing them to benefit from increased user adoption and growth within the Terra ecosystem.  \n\nTerra Core is a golang implementation of the Terra Protocol and built using the Cosmos SDK, which provides a robust framework for constructing blockchains that run atop the Tendermint Consensus Protocol.   \n\nThe Terra network provides an ecosystem of stablecoins (a family of stablecoins pegged to a growing list of fiat currencies) and a mining token, Luna, which serves as a governance mechanism, volatility absorption tool, and rewards capture through transaction volume and seigniorage.  \n\nTerra stablecoins achieve stability through consistent mining rewards with a contracting and expanding money supply. If the system has detected that the price of a Terra currency has deviated from its peg, it must apply pressures to normalize the price. Like any other market, the Terra money market follows the simple rules of supply and demand for a pegged currency.\n\nTerra miners play a foundational role in the security and stability of Terra. They provide the former by participating in PoS consensus. They provide the latter by absorbing short-term volatility in Terra demand. Stable demand for mining is a core requirement for both security and stability. To achieve this, the protocol aims to offer stable and predictable rewards in all economic conditions, booms and busts alike. Rewards are seen via transaction fees and seigniorage (Luna burn).\n\nThe network emphasizes decentralized allocation of resources from its fiscal policy to support the development, continued growth, and steady income for decentralization applications (dApps) building on Terra. To receive this seigniorage from the Treasury, a dApp needs to register for consideration as an entity that operates on the Terra network. dApps are eligible for funding depending on their economic activity and use of funding. There are regular voting intervals where Luna validators vote to accept or reject new dApp applications for Treasury accounts.",

The community can reference a passed Text Proposal to the core developers to indicate that a feature (requiring potentially a soft or hard fork) is in significant demand.  \n- Parameter Change Proposals are a special type of proposal which, once passed, will automatically go in effect by directly altering the network's parameter specified. For each module, you can find the parameters associated with it by browsing to the Parameters section of the module specification.  \n- The Community Pool Spend Proposal defines a special proposal that upon being passed, will disburse the coins specified in Amount to the Recipient account using funds from the Community Pool.  \n- The Tax Rate/Reward Update Proposal defines special proposals which allow the Tax Rate and Reward Weight values to be voted on and changed accordingly, subject to the policy constraints.  \n- Software Upgrade Proposals are for the moment considered unavailable, as they have not yet been implemented. They thus share the same semantics as a simple Text Proposal.",

It intended to run the sale for two weeks, but the team sold out of its token allotment in one day. Purchasers were able to purchase tokens through three options:\n- __Public Sale Option A1 (Staking Round #2):__ This option allowed participants to purchase tokens at $0.50 per AVAX, which was subject to a one-year vesting schedule with quarterly unlocking.\n- __Public Sale Option A2__ __(Staking Round #2):__ This option allowed participants to purchase tokens at $0.50 per AVAX, using an 18 month vesting schedule, with quarterly unlocking. Option A2 allowed purchasers to a much larger set of tokens than Option A1.\n- __Public Sale Option B:__ This option allowed participants to purchase tokens at $0.85 per AVAX, with no lockups. In order to prevent concentration and incentivize distribution, this allocation enforced a maximum check size of $5,000.\n\nIn total, Ava Labs raised $42 million, but this total is subject to de minimis changes because each pool was oversubscribed. Therefore, the total funding could be lower once the team finishes processing refunds.",

Litecoin aimed to keep the best aspects of Bitcoin while making some optimizations for its use as a medium of exchange.\n\nNotably, Litecoin implements 2.5 minute block times and an 84 million max supply. Charlie Lee's original thinking was that quicker block confirmations would increase transaction throughput and reduce the amount of time merchants would need for block confirmations. Additionally, he thought the 84 million max supply would prevent the coin from becoming too scarce and expensive. Litecoin uses Scrypt, a memory intensive hashing algorithm, in order to better allow individuals to mine Litecoin with commodity hardware (although \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/blog/application-specific-integrated-circuits-asics\"\u003eASICs\u003c/a\u003e have been developed for Litecoin mining over the past few years). Finally, Charlie Lee, recognizing the mistakes of the few altcoins launched prior to Litecoin, wanted Litecoin to be launched in a fair manner, electing to only do a 150 coin (3 block) premine to allow people to get in early.\n\nCharlie Lee left Coinbase in June 2017 to head the \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/organization/litecoin-foundation\"\u003eLitecoin foundation\u003c/a\u003e, which stewards the Litecoin project, and finances Litecoin Core development.

Chainlink aims to solve the oracle problem, an inherent limitation of blockchain networks that prevents them from connecting to external data resources that exist off-chain. Through a decentralized network of independent oracle node operators, Chainlink provides a wide range of decentralized services to smart contracts including Price Feeds (financial market data used to power a large portion of the DeFi economy), verifiable randomness (enabling the creation of dynamic NFTs and fair on-chain gaming applications), proof of reserve (providing proofof off-chain collateral that is backing stablecoins and cross-chain tokens), the Keeper Network (transaction automation bots that provide autonomous DevOps services), and more. \n\nThe recently released Chainlink 2.0 whitepaper also broadens the capabilities of Decentralized Oracle Networks (DONs) and describes how the Chainlink Network is evolving to provide both tamper-proof data delivery and secure off-chain computation. Chainlink oracle networks enable the creation of highly scalable and privacy-preserving hybrid smart contracts that combine on-chain and off-chain infrastructure. Off-Chain Reporting, a recent scalability upgrade of the Chainlink Network that lowered the gas costs of oracle updates by 90%, represents the first move towards achieving the goals laid out in the whitepaper.",

Chainlink is not a monolithic network like a blockchain but rather an infrastructure and framework for building blockchain-agnostic oracle networks that augment the capabilities of blockchains and layer-2 protocols.\n\nEach Chainlink oracle network consists of multiple independent oracle nodes that fetch data from multiple independent data providers, aggregate the data into a single data point, and deliver it on-chain to be consumed by smart contracts. Chainlink's flexible architecture allows for highly configurable oracle networks that can be composed of any selection of node operators and data providers and that use different network parameters such as update frequency, fee payment amounts, and more.\n\nChainlink nodes are operated by professional DevOps infrastructure providers, leading enterprises, and premium data providers who supply smart contracts with access to cryptographically signed data for additional security guarantees. Because of its flexible design, Chainlink can provide any type of data or computation to any smart contract application operating on any blockchain network.",

A year later Hayden Adams began working on turning this idea into a functional product. After receiving several grants as well as $100,000 from the Ethereum Foundation, Uniswap launch in November 2018. The protocol quickly gained liquidity and started facilitating meaningful volume. Six months after launching, a fundraising round was \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/paradigm-backs-decentralized-exchange-protocol-uniswap\"\u003ecompleted\u003c/a\u003e, led by Paradigm to allow the addition of two more employees.\n\nWhat makes Uniswap unique is that it solves the problem of high spreads for illiquid assets on order-book exchanges. This problem exists because there is little incentive for professional market makers to provide liquidity on very thinly traded assets. However, with Uniswap, anyone can be a market maker by depositing assets into a pool and earning fees based on the amount of trading activity. One downside to this model is that there is substantial slippage for large orders as the price paid increases as the quantity demanded increases.",

            "technology_details": "Uniswap is a protocol that facilitates the exchange of tokens on Ethereum. Unlike most other DEXs, there is no native token and every action occurs on-chain. Typically, exchanges function by using an order-book where market makers set the price at which they are willing to buy and sell an asset. The difference between these prices is how they get paid for this work. Uniswap does away entirely with the order book and instead opts to have market makers deposit assets into a pool that traders can then trade against. The price is determined algorithmically based on the proportion of the two assets being traded.\n\nPrice mechanism\nUniswap uses what's known as a Constant Product Market Maker that is designed to always provide liquidity regardless of the order size or amount of funds in the pool. This is achieved by asymptotically increasing the price as the size of the buy order increases, leading to potentially significant slippage on large orders. Trading pools consist of an ERC-20 token and an equivalent amount of ETH, with the product between the two sums remaining constant. Any given transaction increases one sum while decreasing the other and the price changes based on the ratio between the two. Users can also swap between two ERC-20 tokens, however, Uniswap will perform two separate actions with each of their respective pools.\n\nProviding liquidity\nWhen liquidity providers add to a pool, they receive newly minted liquidity tokens entitling them to their proportion of the total pool as well as the 0.3% fee generated off each trade. These tokens are not speculative and simply keep track of how much of the pool is owed. Liquidity providers need to supply both assets in the same proportion they are currently at, otherwise, they will change the ratio and thus price. This would result in the immediate loss of money as the price change should get arbitraged out by trading bots. Even if providers supply the correct ratio of each asset, large price changes can result in the loss of money. (Details on how this work can be found here). Therefore, providers are hoping for substantial volume of trading around the price they entered such that the fees generated account for any potential losses.",

          "background": {
            "background_details": "As early as 2010, shortly after Satoshi implemented a block limit into Bitcoin, discussions around \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/block-size\"\u003eblock size\u003c/a\u003e began. However, discussions around the block limit largely stayed in the background until 2017 when tensions within the Bitcoin community rose over rising transaction fees and increasingly divergent opinions on scaling Bitcoin. Supporters of bigger blocks believed that for Bitcoin to fulfill the vision of a peer-to-peer electronic currency as outlined in the original whitepaper, it was crucial to raise the block limit in order to increase transaction capacity. Bitcoin Cash proponents pushed for a system that could scale to VISA level transaction throughput without second layers and while maintaining affordable transaction fees. It rejected the philosophy of Bitcoin Core that Bitcoin's central value proposition is censorship resistance and trust-minimization, and that Bitcoin full nodes needed to be maximally decentralized to achieve this. Instead of envisioning Bitcoin as a settlement layer or a Digital Gold, Bitcoin Cash envisions Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, emphasizing Bitcoin's utility as a medium of exchange.\n\nIn 2017 at the Consensus conference amidst rising transaction fees on Bitcoin and increasingly tense debate around the Bitcoin block limit, a meeting with miners and Core Developers took place in what is referred to as the “New York Agreement”, where an agreement was reached to support \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/segregated-witness\"\u003eSegWit\u003c/a\u003e and a 2MB \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/hard-fork\"\u003ehard fork\u003c/a\u003e. Known as SegWit2x, this proposal was backed by over 80% of the network’s hash rate. Despite the desires of miners, users wanted to activate SegWit without the block size increase. They set a date (August 1, 2017) where Bitcoin would \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/soft-fork\"\u003esoft fork\u003c/a\u003e to support SegWit and keep the 1MB block size. Enough nodes signaled support for it that they forced miners to accept or have their blocks rejected by the network. A faction of the bigger blocks camp, rejected SegWit altogether, citing frustrations with the prioritization of SegWit over bigger blocks, and on August 1, 2017 they launched a hard fork of Bitcoin called Bitcoin Cash, with 8MB block limits. The 8MB block limit was later increased to 32MB in 2018 after another contentious hard fork regarding a minority faction's desire to raise the block limit to 128MB. This hard fork resulted in the creation of Bitcoin SV, a fork of Bitcoin Cash. \n\nAlthough increased block capacity could increase transaction throughput on-chain, it could potentially restrict the universe of participants who could be capable of running full \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/node\"\u003enodes\u003c/a\u003e, thus making this something the community needs to address in order to be able to execute on its vision of a decentralized peer-to-peer cash system. In addition to pursuing on-chain scalability through larger block sizes, Bitcoin Cash prioritizes fast-paced development of technological improvements in opposition to the more conservative philosophy of Bitcoin. To date, Bitcoin Cash has 6 competing node implementations: BitcoinABC, Bitcoin Unlimited, BXT, Parity, Bitprim, and Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin Cash has also had a variety of upgrades, the most recent of which taking place of 05/15/2021. This upgrade made a variety of changes including the removal of the unconfirmed transaction limit, the enabling multiple OP_RETURNS, the implementation of double-spend proofs, , the inclusion of Cash Improvement Proposals (CHIPs) to introduce new specification changes to the protocol, and the inclusion of a new mining block default limit size of 8 MB.

As such, it went through two halvings to date; in November 2012, and again in July 2016, each cutting the initial block reward by half. On average, Bitcoin Cash generates new blocks every 10 minutes, rewarding miners with 12.5 new BCH and the total transaction fees from the preceding block. Each block has a 32MB limit and block rewards are \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/halving\"\u003ehalved \u003c/a\u003eevery 210,000 blocks (approximately 4 years). Eventually, once the 21 million BCH hard cap has been reached, block rewards will transition entirely to transaction fees shifting the security model of the protocol to one based on demand for block space versus one based on demand for BCH. Bitcoin Cash's next halving is expected to happen in May 2020.\n\nThe difference between BCH and BTC supply curves since the fork can be explained by the difficulty adjustment algorithm which included one addition compared to Bitcoin: the Emergency Difficulty Adjustment (EDA). This mechanism was set by the Bitcoin Cash developers to incentivize miners to prioritize BCH’s transactions over that of BTC’s. Miners leveraged this mechanism to maximize their profit by reducing their BCH mining output while waiting for the Emergency Difficulty Adjustment to reduce BCH’s difﬁculty, which in turn would lead to higher returns. As a result, 120,000 more BCH than BTC were mined from August 01, 2017, until November 13, 2017, when Bitcoin Cash underwent a hard fork to change the difficulty adjustment algorithm. \n\n",

Economic nodes (aka \"full nodes\") receive transactions from other network participants, validate them against network consensus rules and double-spend vectors, and propagate the transactions to other full nodes that also validate and propagate. Valid transactions are sent to the network's mempool waiting for mining nodes to confirm them via inclusion in the next block.\n\nMining nodes work to empty the mempool usually in a highest-to-lowest fee order by picking transactions to include in the next block and racing against each other to generate a hash less than the target number set by Bitcoin Cash's \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/difficulty-level\"\u003edifficulty\u003c/a\u003e adjustment algorithm.

The requests for purchase and redemption of BUSD results in movement of cash in and out of the reserve, which in turn has the supplyController address mint and burn tokens accordingly. For example, purchase of $100 will result in issuance of 100 BUSD tokens and $100 being deposited into the reserve. On the other hand, redemption of 100 BUSD tokens results in destruction of those 100 tokens and withdrawal of $100 from the reserve to be given to the redeemer. As a resort to critical security threat, Paxos can pause transfer and approval of BUSD tokens via OpenZeppelin’s contracts.\n\nAlthough the creation and destruction of the tokens occur through Paxos, other transactions in BUSD follow ERC-20 smart contracts. This ensures security for BUSD, as it gets rid of the need for third parties and instead relies on the long-tested global blockchain network. Additionally, trading tokens is simple with BUSD because viewing and transferring of BUSD is automatically supported by most Ethereum-supporting exchanges and wallet applications.\n\nDue to the Trust Charter, the New York State Department of Financial Services regulates and monitors the company and its operating procedures to make sure it follows New York banking laws. These banking laws also requires Paxos to have the power to freeze accounts as well as wipe the balance of said frozen accounts. BUSD has a function called “setLawEnforcementRole.” As its name implies, it can give administrative permissions over the circulating BUSD supply. Paxos has assured that the function is for preventing illegal activities such as money laundering and terrorist financing and that it will not be used unless required by law.",

Unlike other PoS models, PPoS does not reward, nor does it put validator or user funds at risk of being slashed (a loss of funds used to promote honest node and user behavior).

A total of 2.5 billion ALGO tokens (25% of the initial supply) were granted to the founders and the Algorand Foundation to support continued protocol development. The rest of the ALGO will be distributed through rewards, grants, and auctions as detailed in the supply curve section. "

The ALGOs will be distributed via various programs like hackathons, competitions, and events.\n\nThere will be a maximum of 10 billion ALGOs in circulation (minus the 20.5 million burned ALGOs from the inaugural auction early redemption program in Aug. 2019 as well as the 5 million burned Algos from the final auction redemption window in Jul. 2020). The ALGOs will be introduced into the network over time as follows:\n\nEstimated ALGOs to be injected into circulation (initially via auction, distributed over time) - 2.5 billion\nEstimated participation rewards (distributed over time) - 1.9 billion\nEarly relay node runners (distributed over time) - 3.1 billion\nAlgorand, Inc. - 2.0 billion \nAlgorand Foundation - 0.5 billion\n\nAuction refund program\nIn Aug. 2019, Algorand offered auction investors the opportunity to receive a 90% refund on their purchased tokens. Investor returns totaled $19.9 million tokens, which constituted almost 80% of the original auction supply. The Algorand Foundation later burned these ALGOs as well as the 609,343.1208 AGLOs that address received as participation rewards (aka inflation), permanently removing them from circulation.\n\nIn Jun. 2020, the 2019 Algo auction participants who did not avail of the early redemption window in Aug. 2019 qualified to opt for a second and final Auction redemption window. Investor returns totaled five million ALGO. As occurred during the optional early redemption in August 2019, all Algos returned via this refund mechanism were burned (permanently taken out of circulation).\n\nRelay node accelerated vesting\nOn Sep. 30th, 2019, relay nodes voted in favor of delaying their ALGO payouts, which would allow Algorand and relay node operators to discuss potential modifications to the rewards schedule. Algorand investors USV and Pillar offered support for a new, elongated vesting schedule since the ALGO supply growth at the time was \"too large relative to the state of adoption.\" Relay nodes opted to delay their ALGO rewards twice more until the network passed EIP-11252019AF, which extended the vesting plan from two years to five years, meaning payouts would complete by the end of 2024. But this new schedule rewarded relay nodes by increasing their share of the ALGO supply by 25% and offered an accelerated vesting schedule should the price of ALGO reach specific targets.\n\nUnvested tokens dedicated to relay nodes will now vest according to the following guaranteed base vesting schedule:\nYear 1 (2020) 3% (for a total of 17%, as relay nodes had already received 14% of their total share at this point)\nYear 2 (2021), 8% (for a total of 25%)\nYear 3 (2022), 25% (for a total of 50%)\nYear 4 (2023), 35% (for a total of 85%)\nYear 5 (2024), 40% (for a total of 125%)\n\nAlthough this schedule can accelerate depending on the 30-day moving average of AGLO price, Algorand used the base vesting schedule to determine the supply curve.",

Subsequently, 1000 random tokens are selected with their owners then approving the block proposed by the first user. \n\nThese phases are ensured by the core protocol called Binary Byzantine Agreement, or Byzantine Agreement ★ (‘Star’), encompassing the following advancements:\nCryptographic sortition (self-selection) To prevent an adversary from targeting committee members, BA★ uses verifiable random functions (VRFs) to randomly select committee members in a private and non-interactive way. \nParticipant replaceability. BA★ mitigates adversary targeting a committee member by requiring committee members to speak just once, thus becoming irrelevant to BA★. \n\nExperimental results running on 1,000 Amazon EC2 VMs demonstrate that Algorand can confirm a 1 MByte block of transactions in ~22 seconds with 50,000 users, latency remains nearly constant when scaling to half a million users, it achieves 125X the transaction throughput of Bitcoin, and that Algorand achieves acceptable latency even in the presence of actively malicious users. \n\nA test network for the protocol was launched in July 2018, and the first open-source code was released on Github in October 2018. As such, Algorand encourages anyone to audit its version of the VRF, forked and extended from the widely popular libsodium cryptographic library.  ",

Community members can post code changes on the network, and stakeholders can use the Pure Proof-of-Stake (PPoS) consensus model to vote on whether to accept or reject the changes. Users are given the additional ability to reach a consensus on the parameters following a given outcome. For instance, if a proposal is accepted, community members collectively determine which block the update to implement. Any user can participate in Algorand’s governance system.\n\nAt the moment, the Algorand team constructs and releases protocol upgrades. But as described in the consensus-based approach above, node operators ultimately determine whether to accept or reject the code changes. Once Algorand releases a protocol upgrade, at least 90% of network nodes must approve the change (done simply by upgrading their node) before the code changes are considered active (i.e., are accessible to users and developers). If approved, the remaining network nodes have a grace period of 140,000 blocks (about seven days) to complete the upgrade before being \"kicked-off\" (unable to sync with) the network. This \"upgrade-required window\" recently increased from 10,000 blocks to 140,000 blocks with the activation of Algorand v2.0.2",
